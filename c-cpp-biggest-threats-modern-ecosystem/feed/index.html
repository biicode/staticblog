That&#039;s what communicating with a serial device is, or serving applications over HTTP... you&#039;re pushing bits, shoveling bits.. whatever you want to call this.
Now if you need to run some optimized algorithms where cycles seriously count to the tune of changing an application from taking days to taking hours, okay... give me C++.  If I need to modify those bits with special CPU instructions or need to know what data lies on L1 cache or whether access is going to suffer from NUMA bottle-necking in practice.. okay, give me C or C++.
But I hope to never write another asynchronous webserver in C++ for as long as I live!  Thank the heavens we have a fast viable alternative such as Go, Rust, Nim, DLang, Scala, or even PyPy!]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For people who want to push bits around from place to place without hassle, good god let&#8217;s please get C++ and C out of the discussion!

I suspect we agree on most of the underlying ideas, and my disagreement was mostly related to the way you expressed them. I must say that I am very skeptical about Rust, because we have already seen many new languages appear with great promises to revolutionize everything, and then turn out to be a fad and disappear into oblivion. Good, new ideas in programming languages are important, and new languages are a way to promote them and popularize them, but it takes a lot more to make a programming language successful. In the PL academic community, you basically don&#039;t even get to defend your dissertation if you haven&#039;t invented a handful of languages. PL concept debate is certainly good in the academia, but widespread acceptance is a whole different story.
In spite all the baggage it has to carry around, C++ has a history of being able to grow, and fagocitate new ideas and concept, sometimes shamelessly stolen (why not?) from other languages. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if in the next 20 years C++ will bury Rust and a lot of similar newcomers.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your clarifications, which make sense.

You are right, they are not competing,and they will have a long live together. When I wrote &quot;ask a pythonist&quot;, &quot;ask a C++&quot; is a shortcut to say, ask a smart programmer to do this task in language X.
The point of the articles is not Python vs C/C++, the real &quot;menace&quot; (it is not menace if it results it is a better language and we all improve with better dev processes) is Rust. Rust has the potential to get a large part of development that as today is done in C/C++. It is not a religious argument that C and C++ should always win and be loved and the enemies should be killed. The best technologies will survive and this is good. When we started to develop biicode was much server based and used Java, then migrated everything to Python, which we have been used for almost 2 years and is a perfect fit for the problem. So no religious argument about any language, just talking about the perception I get from the communities (like the local Meetup C/C++, attending conferences like Meeting C++, and soon will be presenting in C+Now), and their/our concerns, the way we see the new languages as Rust and our current ecosystem of dev tools]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, Python and C/C++ are much complementary, and they are my 3 fav languages as today.
