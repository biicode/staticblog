Therefore, instead of seeing &quot;...&quot; in each block, I would appreciate to see a at least at the very end of the article a minimal example fully working.
Apart from the typos pointed out by Denis, I see the following:
- ptr or _ptr?
- derived should derive from base
- Poly seems to need a &quot;void f()&quot; method that calls ptr-&gt;f()
- vonst should be const
-  &quot;hello world!&quot;s. What about the ending &quot;s&quot;?
This is what I ended up with:
http://goo.gl/ps7ky6 - to test in an online compiler
http://pastebin.com/jDcgqCqi - to see it in pastebin
Please don&#039;t take this as a negative comment but as a constructive one, which is what it intends to so that the following articles are even better. Keep up the good work!]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great idea Manu, but I would like to see a compiling example to be able to play with it.

But what if we have a large class hierarchy, for instance 15 classes and each has three polymorphic functions ? Seems then we should have 45 free functions and what if we need to use a class implementation details in these function ?
What about code structure, will it spread over entire project ? I mean if I have a class A I know that it is in source file A.h / A.cpp, where then should I place implementation of polymorphic function, in place where it going to be used ?
Are there any other advantages besides simplifying the control of object&#039;s life cycle ? Maybe much easier to keep in vector shard_ptr instead of raw pointer ?
There are some typos in article, like using &quot;overrides&quot; instead of &quot;override&quot; keyword, &quot;std::vector objects;&quot; - won&#039;t compile because it&#039;s abstract class (should be std::vector) and in the penultimate code sample argument of function f should be &quot;const std::string &amp;str&quot;.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nice Idea.
