id="more-671"></span></p><p><strong>What brings you to Madrid, Jorge?</strong></p><p>After several years studying and working in San Francisco, I decided to come back to Madrid, the place where I was born and where I have spent most of my life. Here I have family and friends. My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby so we want to be close to ours right now. Besides, in the United States you can&#8217;t do anything without a working Visa and the lawyers of the company I worked for, sent a few hours later my dossier to the USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) for the renewal of my visa, so we had to make a choice about where to settle and Madrid seemed the best option for all of us.</p><p><strong>Do you always stay here?</strong></p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Are you planning to stay here for good or for a long term period?</p><p>Well, I don&#8217;t now yet. Madrid is a great place to be, I love the city and my job, also  the rhythm and movement in here, the professional stage, there is a lot of colour! I love travelling and I consider myself an eager person so it&#8217;s possible that we keep moving in a few years.</p><p><strong>How did you come to work with us?</strong></p><p>A week after landing in Madrid I saw a very attractive offer in Domestika.org, in which you were looking for a UI/UX Designer, I really liked the requirements you were looking for and I felt it was a perfect fit with my profile and background.</p><p>Although I had already designed for software developing companies, this felt different, biicode&#8217;s project is soooo interesting!</p><p>Manuel and Diego told me the need to unify web technology and design for this reuse source code software and I found it challenging. It&#8217;s the most complicated and rewarding project I&#8217;ve ever done. Biicode it&#8217;s a start-up with a huge potential, I want to be part of this giving my two cents.</p><p><strong>Working as a Visual &amp; UX Designer at biicode, what is it like?</strong></p><p>As I was just saying, this is more than a challenge, I love working with such a professional team, not even in &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; had I seen such a high level, I like to work closely with programmers and developers, seeing the tech we work with and how well does communication work. In the team we all get along very well and it shows in the results of our product.</p><p><strong>Does it feel any different from where you have been before?</strong></p><p>Actually my goals are always the same, get a friendly and simple visual environment.</p><p>At biicode, the daily scrums allow a fluidity and agility developing, I get lots of feedback and priorities are discussed without the need to wait for eternal protocol confirmations. I n other companies I have worked for, my designs went through several departments that sometimes the final result turned out very different from the original. Here, the flexibility relies on colleagues work, everyone is great at what they do. It&#8217;s such a collaborative environment in which communication is easy and fast.</p><p><strong>Where does you heart lies in designing?</strong></p><p>In terms of design I love simplicity and cleanness. My efforts are in 50/50 usability  and design, users having good visual experiences while finding what they are looking for quickly. Typography, flat design, iconography, color coding, large images, infinite scrolls, simple and accurate content.</p><p><strong>And which are the most interesting territories in terms of design innovation?</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s very capable people anywhere. I have had the pleasure of working with truly cracks. In San Francisco two of each three people either programs or designs, and the third is always a professional hipster. SO it&#8217;s easy to quickly soak for trends. I like and follow the work of many designers NY, LA, Berlin, MAD and BCN.</p><p><strong>What exciting things do you think technology will do for designers in the near future?</strong></p><p>I think the future is now, we work in the clouds and we share everything :). Everything is already happening, internet of things, more intuitive CMS, online software is moving rapidly, multi-device platforms, more reliable information, libraries&#8230; I only miss a standard for web browsers and everyone will be happier. I&#8217;d like to work someday with holographic technology, it&#8217;s very idyllic, but it&#8217;s already a reality.<br

title="Codemotion Rome" href="http://rome.codemotionworld.com/2014/" target="_blank">Codemotion Rome</a> gave me the chance to speak about <a
title="Graph database | Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database" target="_blank">Graph databases</a></strong>, so I gladly accepted. Rome is an awesome city, there is a lot of history in a small amount of space. Sometimes you can feel overwhelmed in that historical environment. On the other side of things, You can enjoy tons of good food and coffee. <strong>Let’s talk about the conference</strong>.</p><p><span
id="more-265"></span></p><h4>Opening Party</h4><p>Opening party took place in <a
title="Temple of Hadrian | Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Hadrian" target="_blank">Templo di Adriano</a>, an historical temple built in 145. There we had the chance to listen to some of the speakers giving a lightning talk about different topics. After the lightning talks we had some beers and appetizers, meanwhile I met <a
title="@RichardWarburto" href="https://twitter.com/RichardWarburto" target="_blank">Richard Warburton</a>, who was one of the speakers and author of <a
title="Java 8 Lambdas | O'Reilly" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do" target="_blank">Java 8 Lambdas book</a>. I also met <a
title="teowaki, Happier development teams" href="https://teowaki.com/" target="_blank">teowaki</a> team, composed by two nice spaniards who are building a tool to improve team communications.</p><h4>First Day</h4><p>The event took place in Università Degli Studi III, Engineering Faculty, after locating the venue and looking for my speaker clearance I had to choose between all the interesting talks. In first place I went to listen <strong><a
title="@jboner" href="https://twitter.com/jboner" target="_blank">Jonas Bonér</a>, Typesafe’s CTO, who talked about reactive applications using <a
title="akka" href="http://akka.io/" target="_blank">Akka</a></strong>, I’m building a CI platform using this technology so I’m very interested in the topic. He explained us how the requirements and the environment have changed and one way to tackle the complexity inherited from this changes.</p><p>Right after Jonas talk, I spoke a bit with him about the topic in detail, He’s an awesome guy.</p><p>Then I enjoyed some of the free coffee and sweets and I spent the next two hours practicing my talk. <strong>After lunch I gave <a
title="Graph Databases presentation, by @fcofdezc" href="http://www.slideshare.net/fcofdezc/grap-34083497" target="_blank">my talk about Graph Databases</a></strong> with full room and people asking cool questions.</p><div

class="wp-image-280 size-full" title="Graph Databases talk, at Codemotion Rome 2014" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/graph_databases_codemotion_rome_2014.png" alt="graph databases talk image" width="630" height="302" /><p
class="wp-caption-text">Graph Databases talk, at Codemotion Rome 2014</p></div><p>Once I gave my talk, I went to listen <a
title="@FrancescoC" href="https://twitter.com/FrancescoC" target="_blank">Francesco Cesarini</a> speaking about <a
title="Erlang programming language" href="http://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>, He’s a very experienced erlang developer and gave us some insights from his past experiences.</p><p>I also had the chance to go to <strong>a round table where Browser performance</strong> was discussed by three engineers of Microsoft, Opera and Firefox. Unfortunately I missed someone representing Google Chrome. Anyway, it was very instructive.</p><p><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-281" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/fran_fernandez_speaker.jpg" alt="Fran Fernandez, speaker at Codemotion Rome" width="400" height="483" />At the end of the day we had some networking beers and I met another spaniard, Alvaro, who also spoke in codemotion about Frontend revolution. I also met some Google engineers and Flavio, a nice Italian guy who drove us to drink some beers near the speakers dinner restaurant. At the speakers dinner we enjoyed some italian food and cool conversations about technology and topics.</p><h4>Second Day</h4><p>Most of the talks until lunch were in Italian so I spent the morning visiting Rome. After lunch I went to some of the talks, like <strong>Software as biology where <a
title="@gar1t" href="http://www.gar1t.com/index.html" target="_blank">Garrett Smith</a> gave us some insights about the parallelism between software and biology and lots of things that we can try to reproduce from nature</strong>. It was a very disruptive and inspiring talk. I highly recommend watching it online: <a
title="Software as Biology | Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/82194443" target="_blank">Software as biology by Garrett Smith</a>.</p><p>After Garrett session I listened <a
title="@felipehoffa" href="https://twitter.com/felipehoffa" target="_blank">Felipe Hoffa</a> and <a
title="@devnook" href="https://twitter.com/devnook" target="_blank">Ewa Gasperowicz</a> speaking about <strong>Google BigQuery using <a
title="Freebase, a community-created database" href="http://www.freebase.com/" target="_blank">Freebase</a> data measuring gender gap</strong>, very cool talk. Finally we had an unofficial speakers dinner organized by Flavio Pic, where we shared a good time and good italian food.</p><p>This post was written by Francisco Fernández, our Software developer and <a
