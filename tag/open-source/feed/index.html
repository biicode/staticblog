href="http://blog.biicode.com/tos-dont-like-well-others/">previous post</a> and we explained then why we hadn&#8217;t paid enough attention to them while the developing the tool. The latter has evolved and added such degrees of complexity that the legal support for the users and the company needed a rethink and a rephrasing to say the least. And that&#8217;s exactly what we did: after consulting with our legal counselors and talking to companies that provide similar services, we have revamped the ToS, check the new ones <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.</p><p><img
class=" wp-image-1597 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/terms-of-service.jpg" alt="biicode's new Terms of service" width="800" height="197" /></p><h2></h2><p><span
id="more-2191"></span></p><h2>A few things about the new Terms of Service</h2><p>The aforementioned degrees of complexity can be listed as follows:</p><ul><li>Going open source</li><li>User code licensing</li><li>Deletion of accounts</li><li>Free and Premium accounts</li></ul><h3>Open Source</h3><p>biicode just announced the release of its code (read more <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-client/">here</a>), thus the new ToS take this new reality into consideration. In fact, alongside the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and the licence under which the user&#8217;s code is, these ToS guide the usage of the tools. Therefor their importance is capital and, as you can see we do not modify them carelessly or unadvisedly; on the contrary we welcome your input and we try as much as possible to be developer friendly. We support as much as we can the C and C++ communities.</p><h3>Licence</h3><p>We have released both the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/client/blob/develop/LICENSE">client</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/common/blob/develop/LICENSE">common services</a> of biicode under <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT licence</a>. We believe this license gives free space for anyone to fork, modify, merge etc. biicode&#8217;s code and thus experiment or even create with it new products. Again, we&#8217;d love to see the C and C++ community blossom with tools that conform a modern programming environment.</p><p>Another aspect of the licensing of code affects the code supported (uploaded to) biicode&#8217;s cloud. We have also modified this application of the ToS in favour of easily licensing user. If no licence is indicated, full copyright protection is granted to the user that uploaded the code except for biicode&#8217;s Minimum Required Licence required to provide the services of access and query to other user&#8217;s of the code uploaded to free accounts, i.e. to show it in the our site.</p><p>All of biicode&#8217;s users will be informed of these changes in an email to come in the next few days.</p><p>Anyway, please take a look at the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">new ToS</a> and tell us what you think. We welcome your feedback and input.</p><p>The post <a

To make one&#8217;s source code dependent on any of them, just use #includes. Today biicode is releasing the source code of the client and the common services as part of a programmatic, comprehensive, full-on open source roadmap.</p><p>One of the biggest aims of biicode&#8217;s founders was to provide a useful and modern tool for the C and C++ communities. Because some of us believe that, despite the wonderful adoption and usage numbers of both programming languages, the current programming environment is not the best to address the challenges the software industry needs. We are trying to improve this landscape by providing a multi-language, cross-platform dependency manager that incorporates CMake as build system. A transversal, multipurpose, open source tool.</p><p>Fortunately for us, there is a vast community of open source advocates amongst the C and C++ developers. Thus our step forward by welcoming the C and C++ communities to our development efforts. We have now on our side a whole army of developers and thus we feel stronger. <strong>Much stronger</strong>.<br

class="aligncenter wp-image-2187 size-medium" title="Yikes! Come join us." src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Panal-baja-300x300.png" alt="biicode is open sourcing its code base starting of by it's brand new open source client" width="300" height="300" /></p><p><span
id="more-2177"></span></p><h2>The challenges ahead: biicode as an open source project</h2><p>Open sourcing software developed by a small start-up like us is not easy. Evidence says that, regardless of community adoption, it does not guarantee success at all. Just today, <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/the-real-reason-open-source-startups-fail/">TechCrunch raises awareness</a> on this regards. It is not only an important decision on which to reflect deeply but neither an easy path to tread on. For example, once the client is released we need to provide the appropriate structure for our community to collaborate and contribute conveniently; not an easy task for a small team overloaded with work.</p><p>We are however committed to do so. We said it in <a
href="https://opensource.com/business/15/1/biicode-open-source-dependency-manager">Opensource.com</a> and we say it here now again: <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">we will release progressively every part of biicode&#8217;s codebase</span>. Step by step, steadily and comprehensively. We know this bold move will provide us with a broader more supportive and collaborative community, an invaluable asset we can enrich with our know-how in dependency management, in software support and software consultancy.<br
/> We had already a steady user growth since mid 2014 but the announcement in Opensource.com boosted the pace as you can see below:</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2188 size-full" title="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Usersgraph.png" alt="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" width="694" height="497" /></p><p>However, not only our user base has grown, in fact the use of the tool has raised considerably. People are experimenting with the workflows and are eventually finding biicode useful to manage their dependencies.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2189 size-full" title="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/APIgraph.png" alt="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" width="655" height="471" /></p><p>This is just part of a larger open source strategy that will include every part of biicode&#8217;s code base and in a broader, more horizontal level we would like to follow <a
href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer</a>&#8216;s path and be completely transparent.<br
/> Because from now on and even before releasing the code, biicode belongs to its users. They have developed projects of many different kinds, providing such a quality feedback we cannot be grateful enough. There are game developers coding <a
href="http://small3d.org/biicodegame/">3D engines</a>, C++ devs trying <a
href="http://yacoder.net/blog/2015/04/05/boost-spirit-flatbuffers-catch-biicode-clion-github/">new technologies</a>, coders interested in <a
href="http://carlosvin.github.io/en/posts/first-biicode-poco.html">deps and package management</a>, keeping <a
href="http://zverovich.net/2014/12/30/using-cppformat-with-biicode.html">libs up-to-date</a> etc.</p><h2>Open source client and common services</h2><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2186 size-full" title="And the Kraken too! Release all things!" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/release-the-kraken-gif.gif" alt="Release the code of the open source client" width="500" height="205" /><br
/> Everything you need to know about biicode&#8217;s client release is in the <a
href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode">GitHub page</a> we have built to host all of our open source project. We welcome you on board and hope to see every single bug captured and fixed, any possible security issue reported and solved and great features and improvements being PR&#8217;ed!</p><p><a

We seek not only collaboration but also guidance. Please let us know where you want the tool to aim. Tell us about your issues when coding and how biicode could come in handy. Join us to provide C and C++ with a better programming environment.</p><h3><strong>The future is yours</strong></h3><p>These are just some of the things we believe a better C and C++ dependency manager should have and that we are already working on (check our <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/community/roadmap/">roadmap</a> to know more about them):</p><ul><li>Connect and host directly to git, zip and other origins</li><li>Support for bigger files</li><li>Better support for binary artifacts</li><li>Social, communication, popularity indices, etc</li><li>Android and other toolchains (Emscripten) support</li><li>Release of an open source in-house server</li><li>AND MANY MORE!</li></ul><p>But the future of this tool is intimately connected to the communities’ will. We want to hear your opinions, lead the way, suggest features and make biicode evolve with you as developers. We are <strong>here to serve C and C++</strong>.</p><p><img

href="https://twitter.com/diegorlosada">Diego Rodríguez-Losada</a> any time during the biicode&#8217;s two-year existence.</p><p>Especially when your product tries to address a common problem to almost 4 million of C and C++ developers &#8211; probably the largest development community by language &#8211; that however lacks what in other languages is a basic and a widespread tool: <strong>a dependency manager</strong>. It is true that several initiatives exist, as <a
href="https://github.com/ryppl?page=1">RYPPL</a>, <a
href="https://jpakkane.github.io/meson/">Meson</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/chrisvana/repobuild">Repobuild</a>, <a
href="http://cpmcpp.org/">CPMCPP</a>, but unfortunately none of them seem to have a large adoption.</p><p>We are proud of where <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/our-story-i/">we came from</a> and confident of <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/file-based-cpp-dependency-manager/">what we have achieved</a>. We have worked hard to build it, developing and iterating a lot: for example we changed our full codebase from java to python in the process, or rebuilt more than 50% of our codebase in 1,5 months to release v1.0. So we didn&#8217;t even consider about making biicode open source. Until today.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/10/reward-sticker.31db154b1.png" alt="biicode open source campaign sticker" width="225" height="223" /></p><p><span
id="more-1832"></span></p><h2>The perks of open source</h2><p>We strongly believe in open source. We use it every day as most of our loved dev tools are open source, and we have realized that we always wanted our tool to be open sourced. Moreover, most of the feedback we are getting from the C/C++ community is that biicode has to be open source.</p><p>The fear of being open source as a business risk, was at least in our investors&#8217; mind, then again, until today. We have told them that we were going open source. They agreed, but with a small request: we have to reach 10K users first. And we accepted, so here we go: join us our quest to become open source. Please join our forces in enough number to show our investors that opening the source code is the right thing to do.</p><p>There are many reasons to believe you&#8217;ll join our mission. First, you will now know what you are installing in your computer, without any lock-in to the company and the possibility to adapt it to your needs. Another reason is simply that you feel the pain, and you would like to have a deps manager for C/C++ you can be part of. And last reason but not least, is to win a Darth Vader++ t-shirt and finally mock your fellow devs that program in inferior (at least not in the dark side :D) languages.</p><p>Besides, as recent Nobel Prize winner <a
href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Tirole">Jean Tirole</a> concludes in his paper <a
href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w7600">The Simple Economics of Open Source</a>, contributors to open source projects do not guide themselves by meer economic value but rather by their own professional growth developing a great tool the community appreciates. It&#8217;s a matter of reputation and skills. It&#8217;s also a matter of relevant tools that provide comfort and save time to devs. Opening our source code will only push the community together, engage the C/C++ community in solving the pain that originated the development of a C/C++ dependency manager like biicode. Initially&#8230; because from now on we will walk this path side by side.</p><h2>The mechanics of the open source quest</h2><p>Our investors need to know the demand is as real as we have promised. We know you guys want biicode to be open source but we need you to take action now and join us in this mission. We need to reach 10.000 users and then we will start to open our source code. We will immediately release the client then, as soon as possible the servers (they are highly coupled to our backend, we need to clean a little bit things first) so in-house hosting is also possible.</p><p>There are three simple steps to become a Master of biicode, <a

Depending on the type of panel (A, B or C) the connections will vary, but it&#8217;s really well explained at the docs of the glcd library (<a

You can accomplish by using a voltage divider implemented with two resistors):<br
/><table><tbody><tr><td><b>SD Pin</b></td><td><b>Mega Pin</b></td></tr><tr><td>DO</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>CLK</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>DI</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>CS</td><td>53</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><strong>PCF8583</strong>: it uses the I2C bus. Since this IC can be powered from 3 to 5 volts, you can use two diodes for adding the 3v cell battery. <strong>Note</strong>: due to the high speed of this bus and to the proximity of a lot of signals (SD, Keyboard&#8230;) it&#8217;s highly likely that you will need to twist and shield the wires. I&#8217;ve shielded them with a lot of aluminium foil; it works great!</li><li><strong>Keyboard</strong>:<br
/><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Keyboard Pin</b></td><td><b>Mega Pin</b></td></tr><tr><td>Data</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>IRQ</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><strong>Enclosure</strong>: a wooden or plastic box.</li></ul><h2>The coding.</h2><p>Open the terminal and execute these commands to see everything on your computer and then compile it and upload to your Arduino.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~/$ bii init blocporc</pre><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~/$ cd blocporc
