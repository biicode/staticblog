href="http://spain-startup.com/?lang=es">8th to the 10th of October</a> at Las Ventas bullfighting arena. It will gather a vast number of leading investors, entrepeneurs, devs, designers&#8230; Take a look at the list <a
href="http://spain-startup.com/speakers-investors/?lang=es">here</a>.</p><p>Biicode will be pitching the 8th in the High Tech start-up competition at around <a
href="http://spain-startup.com/agenda/?lang=es">16:45 in the pitching stage</a>. Once this is over we hope to make some interesting contacts and networking.</p><h2>What biicode is looking for in the South Summit</h2><p><img

But we have to stay focused:<br
/> We are currently looking for our series B funding thus the opportunity to find some smart investor interesting in funding high tech, solidly developed dev tools is unique. Please give us a shout if anyone is interested in having a chat with either <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/pub/diego-rodriguez-losada/10/399/473">Diego Rodríguez-Losada</a> (CEO) or <a
href="https://plus.google.com/+JordiMonCompanys">Jordi Mon Companys</a> (Marketing Manager).</p><p>We are high tech developer&#8217;s tool. This is <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/file-based-cpp-dependency-manager/">why we rock</a> and this is <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/our-story-i/">where we come from</a>. We aim to become <strong>the best dependency manager</strong> for C and C++ languages. We have the team, the ideas and the passion for our product; we need your counsil and trust.</p><p>Find us in the Bizzabo netoworking site → <a
href="https://events.bizzabo.com/thesouthsummit/person/281086">Jordi</a> → <a
href="https://events.bizzabo.com/thesouthsummit/person/281668">Diego</a></p><p>See ya!</p><h3>UPDATE:</h3><p>That was crazy. We had a great time there. We had time to most of the investors we had an appointment with like <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/pablolancry">Pablo Lancry</a> of Bankinter, or <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/pub/javier-ulecia/0/72/274">Javier Ulecia</a> and <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/joseluisgomezblazquez">Jose Luis Gómez</a> both of Bullnet. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our friends and investors from the Fundación Entrecanales, especially without <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/pub/lourdes-%C3%A1lvarez-de-toledo/61/184/516">Lourdes Álvarez de Toledo</a> who managed to introduce us to many other interesting contacts like <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/marcosaubeso">Marcos Aubeso Parellada</a> a Caixa Capital Risc analyst. We also were fortunate enough to meet journalists specialized in the startup spehere like <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/jaimegnovoa">Jaime Novoa</a> who is currently covering in such detail the Spanish start-up scene that <a
href="http://novobrief.com/">Novobrief</a> has become the main reference to anyone willing to have an expert&#8217;s view on the matter.</p><p>We wonder however who has enough time to complete one&#8217;s tasklist in events like this: it&#8217;s practically impossible. For example, we would have loved to say hello to <a
href="https://plus.google.com/+marymgrove">Mary Grove</a> who&#8217;s Google for Entrepeneurs is landing in Madrid in 2015. We couldn&#8217;t be happier to see Madrid&#8217;s start-up scene shake and grow. Welcome guys!<br

/> In conclusion, we had a blast and morevoer we made excellent contacts. Hopefully this high level networking and our hard work (we keep releasing updates and bug fixes every fortnight! Check version 1.8.5. <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/biicode/release_notes.html#release-notes">HERE</a>) will prove useful and will allow us to conclude soon our second round investment.</p><p>Congratulations to <a
href="https://twitter.com/Spain_StartUp">Spain Startup</a> for pulling off such a great event. See you next year.</p><p>The post <a
