All the talks we attended were perfectly structured and really interesting. Outstanding speakers were the main cause of the conference’s success.</p><p><img

Daniel Garcia:  &#8220;Concurrency in Modern C++&#8221;</h3><p>We&#8217;re unconditional fans of <a
title="J. Daniel Garcia C++" href="https://twitter.com/jdgarciauc3m" target="_blank">J. Daniel García</a> &#8211; his slides though are only available in Spanish.</p><p>Unexpected as it was &#8211; because Codemotion Marid 2014 focus&#8217; wasn&#8217;t C ++, surprise! &#8211; <em>Concurrency in Modern C++</em> was packed. It was a 45-minute introduction to the new language mechanisms for portable concurrency in C++ 11/14. A success.</p><p>A brief summary:</p><ul><li>Seems free lunch is over</li><li>C++ offers a portable mechanism for concurrency</li><li>Minimal concurrency through asynchronous tasks</li><li>Use threads to more detailed concurrency control</li><li>mutex as a basic concurrency mechanism</li><li>There&#8217;s a lot more &#8211; using a graphics card without OpenGL or CUDA?</li></ul><h3>J. Daniel Garcia:  &#8220;Simplifying  Dynamic Memory&#8221;</h3><p>J. Daniel explained with grace the difference between moving and copying:</p><ul><li>Everything that is born, dies.</li><li>Copying is expensive, moving is cheap &#8211; My daughter would rather move her homework from the living room to her room than making homework again to locate a copy on each place.</li><li>Use smart pointers &#8211; be mindful when using explicit new/delete + no need for a <a

/> <a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/2014/12/09/charlas-codemotion2014/" target="_blank"> J.Daniel Garcia&#8217;s slides are available in his blog.</a></p><h3>Jorge Barroso: &#8220;Something you always wanted to know about Testing* , but were afraid to ask&#8221;</h3><p>Educational and fun talk by <a
title="Jorge Barroso" href="https://twitter.com/flipper83" target="_blank">Jorge Barroso</a>, explaining why testing has become fundamental. From an Android developer&#8217;s perspective  Jorge gave full advice for all programmers developing in the real world &#8211; not idyllic.</p><p><iframe

A great diversity of technologies, languages, companies and areas of software development met at Codemotion Madrid 2014.</p><p>As usual in this conferences, this diversity wasn’t evenly distributed, more than fifty percent of the conferences were about web. Altough technologies as C++ have also found its way into CodeMotion Madrid 2014 this year, we would like that in future editions other topics could also get more coverage: C/C++, embedded systems, IoT, HPC, industrial software and design, etc.</p><p>About the organization, we think it could be improved, there were talks in which there were no volunteers attending and the speakers had to ask for help to the attendees. Also, the number of attendants exceeded most of the halls&#8217; capacities too many times. Capacity was so low that lots of people weren’t able to attend talks and needed to find a room with an available seat even though they weren’t interested in that talk, just because all the rooms were full.</p><p>If this type of conference wants to increase in popularity and prestige, these are some issues that should be adressed.</p><h4>Codemotion Madrid 2014 Agenda</h4><p>Keep an eye on <a
title="Codemotion Agenda" href="http://2014.codemotion.es/es/agenda.html?recommended=#day1" target="_blank">Codemotion&#8217;s agenda</a> to updates on videos, interviews and slides.</p><p>To sum up, the Codemotion Madrid 2014 showed some disorganization but ended leaving good senses on the attendees thanks to the great level of the speakers.</p><p>The post <a

id="more-1964"></span></p><p>Since C++ is being improved with the new version of its specification (C++11 and beyond), there is a lot of interest in Spain in the new language features’. <em>Using std::cpp</em> has become the Spanish C++ forum where the C++ developers can express their experiences, ideas and start discussions about the present and the future of the language.</p><h2>Using std::cpp 2014: the talks</h2><p>The first talk was “<a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2014/programa/programacion-funcional-basica-en-c/"><strong>Basic functional programming</strong></a>” by the great <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/joaqu%C3%ADn-m-l%C3%B3pez-mu%C3%B1oz/1/515/aaa">Joaquín M. Lopez</a> in which he detailed the use of lambda function in C++11, in order to improve the performance and the quality of source code .</p><p>In the next talk “<a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2014/programa/unspecified-vs-undefined/"><strong>Unspecified vs Undefined</strong></a>” <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansoulie">Juan Soulié</a>, author of the web site <a
href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>, defined the grey areas of the language from which any developer should avoid if possible.</p><p>After a slight break with a coffee in hand, sponsored by <a
href="http://www.indizen.com/">Indizen</a>, <a
href="https://es.linkedin.com/pub/diego-rodriguez-losada/10/399/473">Diego Rodriguez Losada</a>, co-founder and CTO of biicode, presented some support systems for developers to develop software easily such, as CMake or NPM for Python. But his last talk was the best, it focused on biicode a deps manager that is developed to solve the classical nightmare of handling <a

href="http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2014/programa/acabando-con-el-patron-singleton/"><strong>Singleton must die</strong></a>”.</p><p>With renewed strength after lunch, Joaquin again presented the talk “<a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2014/programa/por-fin-entiendo-que-son-las-monadas/"><strong>At last I understand the monads</strong></a>” used especially for futures. If someone has interest in this topic, do not forget that the next 15h January, Joaquin will present “<a
href="http://www.meetup.com/Madrid-C-Cpp/events/218906764/">De 0 a 100 (Taller): mónadas en C++14</a>”.</p><p>Folowing this talk, <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pablo-san-segundo/3b/496/834">Pablo San Segundo</a>, Assistant professor of UPM and chess master, presented his management library of bits in C++: <a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2014/programa/bitscan-c-library-for-bit-manipulation/"><strong>BITSCAN</strong></a>.</p><p>After the last coffee break, sponsored by biicode, “<a

href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/anibal-caceres/2/729/729">Anibal Cáceres</a>, software developer of Ericsson, we discovered we were not developing properly in C++.</p><p>The videos of all talks are in the new<a
