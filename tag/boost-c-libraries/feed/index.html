They are one of the highest quality and best suited C++ libraries in the world, with the spirit and design of being fully compatible with the standard library and its practices.</p><p>However, Boost is not easy to love. It&#8217;s shipped with tons of inter-dependencies, even circular dependencies, and that&#8217;s only for header-only libraries (thankfully 80% of Boost is header-only). For non header-only libs, it&#8217;s a true pain. You should compile those and then link against, being careful about what you are doing.<br
/> Even if setting up Boost manually could be a bit hard, when it works it&#8217;s a pleasure to develop with it.</p><p>At biicode we have been working hard to simplify the process, to make Boost available for any C++ programmer with just an include. But this is only the start, the project has been <a
href="https://github.com/Manu343726/boost-biicode">released as open source</a> to allow everyone contribute and help.</p><p>I hope you like it.<br

id="more-2086"></span></p><h2 id="working-with-boost">Working with Boost libraries</h2><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ sudo apt-get install boost</pre><p>That&#8217;s what most of us do to work with Boost. There&#8217;s no easy way to change the Boost version though, or even have multiple coexistent Boost versions. In addition to the fact that the package-manager way doesn&#8217;t work on Windows.</p><p>The main purpose of biicode is to handle dependencies and improve the development workflow. That means one should take into account:</p><ul><li>A user may want to work <strong>with different versions of Boost</strong>. It should be <strong>easy to switch between Boost versions during development</strong>.</li><li>When dealing with Standard C++, that is, with true portable C++, one should care about multiple compilers and test his/her code with all of them. <strong>It should be easy to switch Boost to work with different compilers</strong>. In our case, that means GCC, Clang, MSVC, MinGW GCC, and the different versions of each one.</li></ul><p>That were the two main objectives I had when I started to work in Boost support for biicode. To <strong>make Boost setup portable across versions, compilers, and platforms</strong>, and at the same time make the <strong>process fully transparent to the user</strong>.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>The biicode Boost setup is very simple: Install each Boost version on a dedicated folder inside the biicode environment, and then rely on Boost&#8217;s bjam to handle the different compilers.</p><p>The setup should also handle all the installation process, which means:</p><ol><li>Download the requested Boost version if it&#8217;s not currently in the biicode environment.</li><li>Bootstrap it.</li><li>Build the libraries.</li><li>Configure <code>FindBoost.cmake</code> to track the installation.</li></ol><p>But how should that look like in user code? I was thinking about it for a long time. Actually, the current interface is just the last of a very long process of testing different approaches.<br
/> I finally ended up trying not to force the user to learn new commands. Instead, try to mimic the current Boost setup with CMake: Instead of calling <code>find_package(Boost COMPONENTS...)</code>, call <code>bii_find_boost(COMPONENTS...)</code>. <strong>The rest of the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is almost the same.</strong></p><p><code>bii_find_boost()</code> wraps the <code>find_package(Boost)</code> call by first setting up the required boost version (Steps 1 and 2 above), building the requested <code>COMPONENTS</code> on demand, finally calling <code>find_package(Boost COMPONENTS ...)</code>.</p><h2 id="a-boost-example-with-biicode">A Boost example with biicode</h2><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#include &lt;boost/coroutine/all.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace boost::coroutines;
void cooperative(coroutine&lt;void&gt;::push_type &amp;sink)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello";
    sink();
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "world";
}
int main()
{
    coroutine&lt;void&gt;::pull_type source{cooperative};
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ", ";
    source();
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "!\n";
}</pre><p>That&#8217;s an example of the Boost.Coroutine library extracted from the Boost docs. It&#8217;s so simple, it just takes a coroutine to print the string &#8220;<em>Hello, world!&#8221;</em> in two steps to see how the coroutine <em>continues</em> its execution on consecutive calls.</p><p>This is the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file of the <a

Hello, world!</pre><p><strong>Issue with MinGW: </strong>To compile Boost.Context, MinGW depends on the Microsoft assembler. Be sure you have ml or ml64 (Depending on your platform) in your PATH. Those executables are usually shipped within Visual Studio, check the Visual Studio Directory/VC/bin/ folder.</p><p><strong>Issue with CMake configure: </strong>Seems that CMake has problems with long-running configures. In some cases, even if the libraries were built successfully, find_package() is not able to find the Boost components. Just rerun bii cpp:configure.</p><p><strong>Header only libraries: </strong>Boost.Spririt is a header only library. Only libraries that must be compiled should be passed to bii_find_boost(). Try with a naked <code>bii_find_boost()</code> call.</p><p>We currently maintain a <code>biicode/boost</code> block with the scripts, which has four different tracks representing the four (three) different Boost versions we have tested: <code>master</code> (The latest version available, currently Boost 1.57.0), <code>1.57.0</code>, <code>1.56.0</code>, and <code>1.55.0</code>. Want to change the Boost version you want? Just go to the <code>biicode.conf</code> of your block and change the <code>biicode/boost</code> track in the <code>requirements</code> entry.</p><p>Refer to <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/c++/examples/boost.html">the docs</a> for more info.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What&#8217;s next?</h2><p>I want to see what people say about this. The main reason we released this as an open source project is to allow the community to improve it with us. This is a first working version, but I&#8217;m sure it could be improved a lot thanks to your feedback and thoughts. Check the <a
href="https://github.com/Manu343726/boost-biicode#issues">README&#8217;s issues entry</a> and the project issues page.<br
/> There are people who already were helping us. I specially thank <a
href="http://thetoeb.de/">Tobias Becker</a> for his feedback on the last steps of the development. His <a
href="http://www.biicode.com/toeb/cmakepp">cmakepp</a> library is a great tool and something I want to use in our Boost scripts in the near future. cmakepp is <em>batteries included</em> CMake!</p><p>I think dependency management for C++ is the right way to go, and supporting Boost libraries is a great step forward.<br
/> Let&#8217;s continue working until a modern C++ development environment becomes reality.</p><p>Hope you enjoy this new feature and, as always, we look forward to read what you think. Just click on the sidebar button to try biicode, check our <a
