href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_San_Segundo_Carrillo">Pablo San Segundo</a> and I were pretty close to the one at the University the very first time Diego explained biicode to us.</p><p>I consider myself lucky for being part of biicode’s birth. The day we decided its name, or those endless meetings with a chalkboard full of diagrams, the first &#8220;battle logo&#8221; as we named our first &#8220;company mascot&#8221;.<br
/> In addition, I really enjoy my work as a university professor and engineer. Thanks to the university I have had the opportunity to devote myself to something that fascinated me since I was a child: robotics. But you cannot master robotics without solid programming skills, so I&#8217;ve been programming since I started hacking the fascinating Commodore 64, with its &#8220;peek&#8221; and &#8220;poke&#8221;, and his incredible voice synthesizer accessible through a simple command: &#8220;say&#8221;.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Hacking the Commodore 64 was classy.</p></div><p><span
id="more-1626"></span></p><h2>Our story II</h2><p>I was barely 12 years old when my first computer game was published. By then, to share code with other rookie programmers you had to literally publish it in journals as pages and pages of text. So using other’s code implied a tedious and patient task of copying.<br
/> Not much has changed since then (except for the blessed CTRL-C and CTRL-V).</p><p>Two years later, I connected my old computer to an Scalextric so I was able to measure and display on the TV lap times, car speeds and lap counters, in addition to a sprite representation of the vehicles when crossing the finish line.</p><p>Then I made new friends who shared my hobby, and so, without giving up football, skates and bicycles, we reserved a place to pound the keys of a very first IBM PC, without a hard drive and with a neon yellow display that delights collectors right now.</p><p>After reading manuals and through hard trial and error, our programming skills evolved into learning new languages to achieve more complex functionalities to satisfy our requirements. BASIC, compiled QBASIC, PASCAL and Modula-2, were on our roadmap before discovering C and its amazing memory control.</p><p>So after making multiplayer games on CGA graphics cards (it’s amazing what you can achieve with only four basic colours!), EGA, VGA and XGA &#8230; constructing a pair of robotic arms and designing a series of more or less useful gadgets came &#8230; college.</p><h2>Instant byte crush</h2><p>I met Diego while I was doing my <a
href="http://www.elai.upm.es/joomla/index.php/webmaster/17-personal/personal-docente/57-webmaster">doctoral thesis</a> on supervisory control systems applied to the control of teleoperated robots over long distances. From the beginning I was surprised by Diego’s intellectual capacity and commitment to excellence. I remember when I asked him as part of his learning to develop a two-dimensional simulation of a solar system, and he delivered only a couple of days later, with a full configurable 3D simulator of a complex celestial system.<br
/> Increasingly, we were collaborating on more projects together of both: research and teaching, supporting each other with our particular vision of things. We both enjoy trying to introduce common sense reasoning in machines and software, and many of our discussions were about simplifying the robots processing into the same categories of our way of thinking. So while Diego was working on the interpretation of environment data for robot localization and mapping, I was trying to include spatial reasoning skills on the control of robot manipulators.<br
/> <img

/> The code we generated was based on many pieces of old code, or third parties that we integrated into our scheme, so Diego began mulling over the idea of ​​permanently interconnect these functions in the cloud.<br
/> Consequently, one day at the University lounge, he exposed to Pablo and me the main ideas of something he called &#8220;Hypercode&#8221; in its most original form. He said then that we had to extend the concept of internet hyperlink to the software, so that a piece of code could use another piece of code without having to copy and manage the duplicate.</p><blockquote><p>Just like Wikipedia</p></blockquote><p>he said</p><blockquote><p>if you need to use any piece of code just link it</p></blockquote><p>Diego&#8217;s proposal fascinated me. His idea was a breath of fresh air, it had a clear goal and was accompanied by ambition and high potential.<br
/> After a dozen national and international research projects, I was still copying and adapting the same code to perform the same mathematical operations, the same simulations, the same port handlers, etc.<br
/> In many cases, I grouped functionalities into libraries and I tried to maintain and update them, but for other functionalities I still had a lot pieces of code repeated again and again with small and no relevant changes among them.</p><h2>A C and C++ dependencies manager, <strong>finally</strong>!</h2><p>How many times have I written the code to manage correctly the TCP/UDP client/server? Or to establish message protocols for communication between components? Or the robust, secure and non-blocking way of handling of a serial port?<br
/> The idea of ​​developing a dependency manager for C / C ++ was evolving gradually and improving towards a much more complete vision about what the software programming should be with a pragmatist view.<br
/> We started to enrich the basic idea with Internet’s magic and the Open Source movement and enthused with it.<br
/> And bit by bit all the pieces start fitting together into an ambitious and beautiful picture. Diego’s thrust, courage and ability were the main ingredients that propelled us and our story into building a new programming paradigm: biicode.</p><div

I’ve been a C and C++ developer for years, I have released some projects as open source, collaborated in industrial projects and met many other developers, I&#8217;ve taught those languages thousands of hours and organized many activities as robotic contests programmed in such languages. So I thought that belonging to that community implied fully understanding such community. It was a big mistake.</p><p><img
class=" wp-image-1597 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/terms-of-service.jpg" alt="Biicode's new ToS" width="800" height="197" /></p><p><span
id="more-1542"></span></p><h2>When adding functionality is your main focus</h2><p>A few days ago, there was a small flame in <a
title="Reddit: programmers willing to try a new dependency manager" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/2ffus9/cc_programmers_willing_to_try_a_new_dependencies/" target="_blank">reddit</a>, as a result of someone posting there our <a
title="Call for beta testers" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4894137/Any-C-Cplusplus-programmers-want-to-try-a-new-depe.aspx" target="_blank">call for beta testers posted in CodeProject</a>. Some redditors were harshly criticizing biicode&#8217;s Terms of Service (ToS).</p><p>They might have had a rude tone, but the truth is that they were pointing out real problems on our ToS. They were written in summer 2013, long before our first version was released. Many things have changed since then, our vision about our tools, workflows and value proposition have changed largely. In our 1.0 release last July we incorporated anonymous usage, you can download and use the client side tools for reading and retrieving code without having to register at all. We have also flattened (to text files) all biicode’s meta-information so it is easier to integrate with other tools as VCS and services as GitHub. We are improving every week, and biicode is becoming amazing.</p><p>But we didn’t pay much attention to our old ToS. They would cost us more time (which is very scarce due to our users’ many feature requests), and would also cost more money (the ToS have to be reviewed by lawyers, and they have the bad habit of billing us). So, after all, we were centered on creating the functionality and didn&#8217;t think deeply enough about the possible concerns the ToS could create in the community.</p><p>So when we read things like: “<em>you authorize biicode to use, update, adapt, transform, enhance or modify in any way the code stored on the platform</em>” we realized that it is not clear at all, in the sense that it can be understood as if biicode could violate the current licence or remove it. And we have not, the rights to do so by any means. If the user code has a licence, everybody, including ourselves, must comply with that licence, and removing it is a law infringement. We immediately started to review the ToS and will change them ASAP so they become clear about the user rights and our real intentions, not only in this issue, but as deeply as necessary.</p><h2>What our ToS really persue</h2><p>It happens that when you build a start-up, you still feel like a colleague developer and you don’t realize that you are running a business, and people might see you as such, even though you are the same developer. And it is OK. The key point here is how you communicate your alignment with the community as a business.</p><p>Some people don’t understand that we propose to have the right to retain a copy of the code uploaded to biicode, even if the author (free account) wants to delete it. The only purpose of this is to make sure that the projects that depend on such code, won’t break. Successful examples of a similar approach can be: Github, that allows to easily fork a repo (that cannot be deleted by the original author) or MavenCentral which does not allow to delete uploaded artifacts.</p><p>These mechanisms are very important for the community as a whole to keep rolling and not breaking thousands of builds or projects in an arbitrary way.</p><p>I am ready to change our ToS, and will soon do it to address the issues mentioned above. So as the great Groucho Marx said once, &#8220;Those are my principles, and if you don&#8217;t like them&#8230;well I have others&#8221;. I will change our ToS to anything that really benefits our community. But I need to know first where your heart relies on.</p><h3>Should biicode have the right to keep a copy of uploaded code?</h3><p>As in all other aspects, you’ve got to walk in the shoes of both users: the one that uploads code and the one that depends on other’s code. They might even be the same person.</p><h3>Post a comment, tell us what you think.</h3><p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong> 16/04/2015]: The ToS have been updated, click here.</p><div

We hope this gives you a hint of the pains and gains of creating a start-up from scratch. This is our story.</p><h2>Why I quit a tenure track position as professor</h2><p>I&#8217;m <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/diegorlosada/">Diego Rodriguez-Losada</a>, the first promoter of biicode and one of its founders. Right before embracing this adventure, I had a comfortable position as a professor in Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.</p><div

id="more-994"></span></p><p>I had been working very hard many years before and after my PhD: publishing research papers in top ranked journals, leading projects, etc. I had recently obtained my tenure track position, I was the first to do so in my department and probably the youngest in my college. I had also recently had my third child. I knew I was smart and I was also confident with my solid background, but compared to some of the brilliant and talented people I met during those years I felt merely mediocre. Meeting in conferences with some of the best brains in my area (Robotics), like S. Thrun or P. Newman was amazing, but realizing that even the local and much younger than me Spanish talents such as <a
href="http://www.ual.es/~jlblanco/">J. L. Blanco</a> were far more capable than me, was simultaneously frustrating and inspiring.</p><h3>Motivation</h3><p>This inspiration motivated me to join the open source movement. I started to release our C/C++ research code, working together with my friends M. Hernando (my former advisor) and A. Valero (former colleague, now an openHW and 3D printers master in BQ). We had a lot of trouble managing dependencies and I wondered about the absence of a good multi-OS dependencies manager for C/C++. I love C/C++, but it made me jealous how languages like python managed so easily to dependencies on third party code (e.g. just the simple task to use a serial port in any OS). Why couldn&#8217;t this be done in C/C++? Why libraries are so huge in C/C++, forcing one to use the whole library even for a simple task? Why one of the most used languages (up to 20% of the world source code) does not have a dependency manager?</p><blockquote><p>Why couldn&#8217;t this be done in C/C++? Why libraries are so huge in C/C++, forcing one to use the whole library even for a simple task? Why one of the most used languages (up to 20% of the world source code) does not have a dependency manager?</p></blockquote><p>So I imagined a simple dependency manager for C/C++ that completely avoided packaging and, at the same time, was able to reuse individual source code files easily. I even realized that such an approach could be great for every language, as exactly the same procedure for publishing, reusing, handling dependencies and conflicts for every language sound the proper approach to the problem. This however is yet a very abstract and probably naïve approach on the matter since dependency managers already exist for other languages and it is almost impossible to compete with them.</p><h2>Let&#8217;s go!</h2><p>I made some initial research to check that indeed nobody was building or trying to build something similar to this idea. And I decided that I could try to build it. How could I even dare think I could be able to build such a system? Why in heaven would I have any chance of succeeding in such a complex and challenging project?</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Mo5.com</p></div><p>Those questions drove me back in time to my early teens, when I was a top student in school, and probably the typical nerd that built miniaturized fm radio emitters with my homemade PCBs (using acids, the reason why my mother was not very happy about it), and programmed videogames in our Amstrad CPC6128 instead of playing them. Those years I learnt that in technology, everything is possible: it is not necessary to be a genius, just smart enough and have a clear goal and ambition, have discipline and commitment and people you can learn from. And I learnt to love challenges. The PhD, the tenure track position… are probably partly just the consequence of that love.</p><p>As you can guess, I decided to quit my position (the first professor to do so and the only one until today in my University) and run my startup: biicode, where we are building this system, and I am enjoying an ecosystem of brilliant (more than me, as usual) developers and software engineers, that are also challenge-hungry and willing to learn. And we are very close to show that this technological challenge is, indeed, also possible. There is only a missing piece, a different kind of challenge I have possible underestimated: the community. This deserves a dedicated post, so stay tuned :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This story continues with Miguel Hernando&#8217;s memories of where everything started. Find the second episode <a
