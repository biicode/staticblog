All the talks we attended were perfectly structured and really interesting. Outstanding speakers were the main cause of the conference’s success.</p><p><img

Daniel Garcia:  &#8220;Concurrency in Modern C++&#8221;</h3><p>We&#8217;re unconditional fans of <a
title="J. Daniel Garcia C++" href="https://twitter.com/jdgarciauc3m" target="_blank">J. Daniel García</a> &#8211; his slides though are only available in Spanish.</p><p>Unexpected as it was &#8211; because Codemotion Marid 2014 focus&#8217; wasn&#8217;t C ++, surprise! &#8211; <em>Concurrency in Modern C++</em> was packed. It was a 45-minute introduction to the new language mechanisms for portable concurrency in C++ 11/14. A success.</p><p>A brief summary:</p><ul><li>Seems free lunch is over</li><li>C++ offers a portable mechanism for concurrency</li><li>Minimal concurrency through asynchronous tasks</li><li>Use threads to more detailed concurrency control</li><li>mutex as a basic concurrency mechanism</li><li>There&#8217;s a lot more &#8211; using a graphics card without OpenGL or CUDA?</li></ul><h3>J. Daniel Garcia:  &#8220;Simplifying  Dynamic Memory&#8221;</h3><p>J. Daniel explained with grace the difference between moving and copying:</p><ul><li>Everything that is born, dies.</li><li>Copying is expensive, moving is cheap &#8211; My daughter would rather move her homework from the living room to her room than making homework again to locate a copy on each place.</li><li>Use smart pointers &#8211; be mindful when using explicit new/delete + no need for a <a
title="Garbage collector" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/147130/why-doesnt-c-have-a-garbage-collector" target="_blank">garbage collector</a></li></ul><p>The Standard Library includes all these features<br
/> <a
href="http://usingstdcpp.org/2014/12/09/charlas-codemotion2014/" target="_blank"> J.Daniel Garcia&#8217;s slides are available in his blog.</a></p><h3>Jorge Barroso: &#8220;Something you always wanted to know about Testing* , but were afraid to ask&#8221;</h3><p>Educational and fun talk by <a
title="Jorge Barroso" href="https://twitter.com/flipper83" target="_blank">Jorge Barroso</a>, explaining why testing has become fundamental. From an Android developer&#8217;s perspective  Jorge gave full advice for all programmers developing in the real world &#8211; not idyllic.</p><p><iframe

title="twitter david bonilla" href="https://twitter.com/david_bonilla" target="_blank">David Bonilla </a>proposed a turn of screw in our minds with a completely full venue.</p><p><a
href="https://speakerdeck.com/davidbonilla/politicamente-incorrecto-codemotion-2014" target="_blank">Politically Incorrect Slides are available here</a>.</p><h2>Organization</h2><p>Codemotion 2014 increased and improved the number of speakers and tracks. A great diversity of technologies, languages, companies and areas of software development met at Codemotion Madrid 2014.</p><p>As usual in this conferences, this diversity wasn’t evenly distributed, more than fifty percent of the conferences were about web. Altough technologies as C++ have also found its way into CodeMotion Madrid 2014 this year, we would like that in future editions other topics could also get more coverage: C/C++, embedded systems, IoT, HPC, industrial software and design, etc.</p><p>About the organization, we think it could be improved, there were talks in which there were no volunteers attending and the speakers had to ask for help to the attendees. Also, the number of attendants exceeded most of the halls&#8217; capacities too many times. Capacity was so low that lots of people weren’t able to attend talks and needed to find a room with an available seat even though they weren’t interested in that talk, just because all the rooms were full.</p><p>If this type of conference wants to increase in popularity and prestige, these are some issues that should be adressed.</p><h4>Codemotion Madrid 2014 Agenda</h4><p>Keep an eye on <a
title="Codemotion Agenda" href="http://2014.codemotion.es/es/agenda.html?recommended=#day1" target="_blank">Codemotion&#8217;s agenda</a> to updates on videos, interviews and slides.</p><p>To sum up, the Codemotion Madrid 2014 showed some disorganization but ended leaving good senses on the attendees thanks to the great level of the speakers.</p><p>The post <a

title="Graph database | Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database" target="_blank">Graph databases</a></strong>, so I gladly accepted. Rome is an awesome city, there is a lot of history in a small amount of space. Sometimes you can feel overwhelmed in that historical environment. On the other side of things, You can enjoy tons of good food and coffee. <strong>Let’s talk about the conference</strong>.</p><p><span
id="more-265"></span></p><h4>Opening Party</h4><p>Opening party took place in <a
title="Temple of Hadrian | Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Hadrian" target="_blank">Templo di Adriano</a>, an historical temple built in 145. There we had the chance to listen to some of the speakers giving a lightning talk about different topics. After the lightning talks we had some beers and appetizers, meanwhile I met <a
title="@RichardWarburto" href="https://twitter.com/RichardWarburto" target="_blank">Richard Warburton</a>, who was one of the speakers and author of <a
title="Java 8 Lambdas | O'Reilly" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do" target="_blank">Java 8 Lambdas book</a>. I also met <a
title="teowaki, Happier development teams" href="https://teowaki.com/" target="_blank">teowaki</a> team, composed by two nice spaniards who are building a tool to improve team communications.</p><h4>First Day</h4><p>The event took place in Università Degli Studi III, Engineering Faculty, after locating the venue and looking for my speaker clearance I had to choose between all the interesting talks. In first place I went to listen <strong><a
title="@jboner" href="https://twitter.com/jboner" target="_blank">Jonas Bonér</a>, Typesafe’s CTO, who talked about reactive applications using <a
title="akka" href="http://akka.io/" target="_blank">Akka</a></strong>, I’m building a CI platform using this technology so I’m very interested in the topic. He explained us how the requirements and the environment have changed and one way to tackle the complexity inherited from this changes.</p><p>Right after Jonas talk, I spoke a bit with him about the topic in detail, He’s an awesome guy.</p><p>Then I enjoyed some of the free coffee and sweets and I spent the next two hours practicing my talk. <strong>After lunch I gave <a
title="Graph Databases presentation, by @fcofdezc" href="http://www.slideshare.net/fcofdezc/grap-34083497" target="_blank">my talk about Graph Databases</a></strong> with full room and people asking cool questions.</p><div

class="wp-image-280 size-full" title="Graph Databases talk, at Codemotion Rome 2014" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/graph_databases_codemotion_rome_2014.png" alt="graph databases talk image" width="630" height="302" /><p
class="wp-caption-text">Graph Databases talk, at Codemotion Rome 2014</p></div><p>Once I gave my talk, I went to listen <a
title="@FrancescoC" href="https://twitter.com/FrancescoC" target="_blank">Francesco Cesarini</a> speaking about <a
title="Erlang programming language" href="http://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>, He’s a very experienced erlang developer and gave us some insights from his past experiences.</p><p>I also had the chance to go to <strong>a round table where Browser performance</strong> was discussed by three engineers of Microsoft, Opera and Firefox. Unfortunately I missed someone representing Google Chrome. Anyway, it was very instructive.</p><p><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-281" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/fran_fernandez_speaker.jpg" alt="Fran Fernandez, speaker at Codemotion Rome" width="400" height="483" />At the end of the day we had some networking beers and I met another spaniard, Alvaro, who also spoke in codemotion about Frontend revolution. I also met some Google engineers and Flavio, a nice Italian guy who drove us to drink some beers near the speakers dinner restaurant. At the speakers dinner we enjoyed some italian food and cool conversations about technology and topics.</p><h4>Second Day</h4><p>Most of the talks until lunch were in Italian so I spent the morning visiting Rome. After lunch I went to some of the talks, like <strong>Software as biology where <a
title="@gar1t" href="http://www.gar1t.com/index.html" target="_blank">Garrett Smith</a> gave us some insights about the parallelism between software and biology and lots of things that we can try to reproduce from nature</strong>. It was a very disruptive and inspiring talk. I highly recommend watching it online: <a
title="Software as Biology | Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/82194443" target="_blank">Software as biology by Garrett Smith</a>.</p><p>After Garrett session I listened <a
title="@felipehoffa" href="https://twitter.com/felipehoffa" target="_blank">Felipe Hoffa</a> and <a
title="@devnook" href="https://twitter.com/devnook" target="_blank">Ewa Gasperowicz</a> speaking about <strong>Google BigQuery using <a
title="Freebase, a community-created database" href="http://www.freebase.com/" target="_blank">Freebase</a> data measuring gender gap</strong>, very cool talk. Finally we had an unofficial speakers dinner organized by Flavio Pic, where we shared a good time and good italian food.</p><p>This post was written by Francisco Fernández, our Software developer and <a
