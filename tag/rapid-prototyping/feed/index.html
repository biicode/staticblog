style="text-decoration: underline;">first corporate client</span> (yay!). Elecnor Deimos is a top tech company with over 500 engineers in staff. They provide software solutions for different sectors ranging from aerospace and aeronautics and defense to transportation or telecommunications in a EU and worldwide levels. The relevance of their clients is descriptive of the quality of their products and services; a few of them are <b>ESA</b> (European Space Agency), <b>NASA</b>, <b>European Union</b>, <b>Telefónica</b>, <b>Siemens</b>, <b>Nokia</b>&#8230;<br
/> For all these top-level companies they develop a huge variety of products like Satellite imagery, air navigation systems, environmental managing systems etc. All of which are top-knotch pieces of software. But what&#8217;s even better for their clients is that Elecnor Deimos is making a bold move to support and use modern technologies like <a
href="https://www.biicode.com">biicode</a> or <a
href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> as we&#8217;ll explain later. This could only mean that a thriving software company is not only keeping its gained quality standards but also expanding their horizons into new sectors and technologies. Never stop moving!</p><p><img

id="more-2205"></span></p><h2>How can biicode help Elecnor Deimos in software development?</h2><p>Elecnor Deimos has a <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">humongous amount of code developed in C and C++</span>. Anyone that has managed, coordinated or simply worked in such an environment knows perfectly how hard finding something can be. Especially when ongoing ideas or code samples are not packaged and thus not ready to be reused easily. If we add to this the fact that no external libs were being called and thus any required lib was <strong>hardcoded</strong> to any given project you&#8217;ll make an idea of how complicated finding <strong>specific code snippets</strong> is. It&#8217;s basically <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">a pain in the neck for everyday coding</span>.<br
/> This was at first, Elecnor Deimos&#8217; idea: to have a biicode <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/pricing/">premium account</a> to which upload and support interesting C and C++ libs and frameworks &#8211; compatible with <strong>Subversion</strong> VCS. Eventually thay would become useful and would be searched and found in the brink of a <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/explore">query</a>. In the long run, their private account will be so populated with code that basically anything required in <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">any new project would be one #include away</span>.</p><h2><strong>Prototyping</strong>: the key start to successful software</h2><p>When a software company is successful it wins more and more clients which means eventually more and more projects. That&#8217;s precisely what has happened to Elecnor Deimos: founded barely 14 years ago by twenty intrepid engineers, it is now a multinational with presence in Spain, Portugal, UK and Romania and over 500 engineers in staff to deliver credited quality services.<br
/> Scaling resources to address the challenges that such a growth represents is not easy at all. Programmers in particular need to be more efficient and learn quick from previous experience. One of the skills most senior devs tend to point out as the one that summarizes better all there experience in the job is prototyping. When project specifications are described a good programmer starts sketching it&#8217;s layout and challenges. Once this is properly done <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">quick solutions can be essayed</span>; why not? At this precise moment of the project it is not only cheap but wise to fail. All sorts of hypothesis and procedures to solve the problem pop up and a quick prototype serves well to try a solution to them. biicode is the perfect match for this methodology. Read more about how to prototype with <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/zeromq-cpp-biicode/">biicode in our example using ZeroMQ</a>.<br
/> Fostering <strong>code discovery</strong>, <strong>quick prototyping</strong> and <strong>easy integration</strong> are the basic goodies anyone can benefit from when using biicode. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg of the things a C and C++ developer can do with biicode. Read more about our features <a
