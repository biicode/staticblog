href="http://blog.biicode.com/tos-dont-like-well-others/">previous post</a> and we explained then why we hadn&#8217;t paid enough attention to them while the developing the tool. The latter has evolved and added such degrees of complexity that the legal support for the users and the company needed a rethink and a rephrasing to say the least. And that&#8217;s exactly what we did: after consulting with our legal counselors and talking to companies that provide similar services, we have revamped the ToS, check the new ones <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.</p><p><img
class=" wp-image-1597 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/terms-of-service.jpg" alt="biicode's new Terms of service" width="800" height="197" /></p><h2></h2><p><span
id="more-2191"></span></p><h2>A few things about the new Terms of Service</h2><p>The aforementioned degrees of complexity can be listed as follows:</p><ul><li>Going open source</li><li>User code licensing</li><li>Deletion of accounts</li><li>Free and Premium accounts</li></ul><h3>Open Source</h3><p>biicode just announced the release of its code (read more <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-client/">here</a>), thus the new ToS take this new reality into consideration. In fact, alongside the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and the licence under which the user&#8217;s code is, these ToS guide the usage of the tools. Therefor their importance is capital and, as you can see we do not modify them carelessly or unadvisedly; on the contrary we welcome your input and we try as much as possible to be developer friendly. We support as much as we can the C and C++ communities.</p><h3>Licence</h3><p>We have released both the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/client/blob/develop/LICENSE">client</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/common/blob/develop/LICENSE">common services</a> of biicode under <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT licence</a>. We believe this license gives free space for anyone to fork, modify, merge etc. biicode&#8217;s code and thus experiment or even create with it new products. Again, we&#8217;d love to see the C and C++ community blossom with tools that conform a modern programming environment.</p><p>Another aspect of the licensing of code affects the code supported (uploaded to) biicode&#8217;s cloud. We have also modified this application of the ToS in favour of easily licensing user. If no licence is indicated, full copyright protection is granted to the user that uploaded the code except for biicode&#8217;s Minimum Required Licence required to provide the services of access and query to other user&#8217;s of the code uploaded to free accounts, i.e. to show it in the our site.</p><p>All of biicode&#8217;s users will be informed of these changes in an email to come in the next few days.</p><p>Anyway, please take a look at the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">new ToS</a> and tell us what you think. We welcome your feedback and input.</p><p>The post <a

I’ve been a C and C++ developer for years, I have released some projects as open source, collaborated in industrial projects and met many other developers, I&#8217;ve taught those languages thousands of hours and organized many activities as robotic contests programmed in such languages. So I thought that belonging to that community implied fully understanding such community. It was a big mistake.</p><p><img

id="more-1542"></span></p><h2>When adding functionality is your main focus</h2><p>A few days ago, there was a small flame in <a
title="Reddit: programmers willing to try a new dependency manager" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/2ffus9/cc_programmers_willing_to_try_a_new_dependencies/" target="_blank">reddit</a>, as a result of someone posting there our <a
title="Call for beta testers" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4894137/Any-C-Cplusplus-programmers-want-to-try-a-new-depe.aspx" target="_blank">call for beta testers posted in CodeProject</a>. Some redditors were harshly criticizing biicode&#8217;s Terms of Service (ToS).</p><p>They might have had a rude tone, but the truth is that they were pointing out real problems on our ToS. They were written in summer 2013, long before our first version was released. Many things have changed since then, our vision about our tools, workflows and value proposition have changed largely. In our 1.0 release last July we incorporated anonymous usage, you can download and use the client side tools for reading and retrieving code without having to register at all. We have also flattened (to text files) all biicode’s meta-information so it is easier to integrate with other tools as VCS and services as GitHub. We are improving every week, and biicode is becoming amazing.</p><p>But we didn’t pay much attention to our old ToS. They would cost us more time (which is very scarce due to our users’ many feature requests), and would also cost more money (the ToS have to be reviewed by lawyers, and they have the bad habit of billing us). So, after all, we were centered on creating the functionality and didn&#8217;t think deeply enough about the possible concerns the ToS could create in the community.</p><p>So when we read things like: “<em>you authorize biicode to use, update, adapt, transform, enhance or modify in any way the code stored on the platform</em>” we realized that it is not clear at all, in the sense that it can be understood as if biicode could violate the current licence or remove it. And we have not, the rights to do so by any means. If the user code has a licence, everybody, including ourselves, must comply with that licence, and removing it is a law infringement. We immediately started to review the ToS and will change them ASAP so they become clear about the user rights and our real intentions, not only in this issue, but as deeply as necessary.</p><h2>What our ToS really persue</h2><p>It happens that when you build a start-up, you still feel like a colleague developer and you don’t realize that you are running a business, and people might see you as such, even though you are the same developer. And it is OK. The key point here is how you communicate your alignment with the community as a business.</p><p>Some people don’t understand that we propose to have the right to retain a copy of the code uploaded to biicode, even if the author (free account) wants to delete it. The only purpose of this is to make sure that the projects that depend on such code, won’t break. Successful examples of a similar approach can be: Github, that allows to easily fork a repo (that cannot be deleted by the original author) or MavenCentral which does not allow to delete uploaded artifacts.</p><p>These mechanisms are very important for the community as a whole to keep rolling and not breaking thousands of builds or projects in an arbitrary way.</p><p>I am ready to change our ToS, and will soon do it to address the issues mentioned above. So as the great Groucho Marx said once, &#8220;Those are my principles, and if you don&#8217;t like them&#8230;well I have others&#8221;. I will change our ToS to anything that really benefits our community. But I need to know first where your heart relies on.</p><h3>Should biicode have the right to keep a copy of uploaded code?</h3><p>As in all other aspects, you’ve got to walk in the shoes of both users: the one that uploads code and the one that depends on other’s code. They might even be the same person.</p><h3>Post a comment, tell us what you think.</h3><p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong> 16/04/2015]: The ToS have been updated, click here.</p><div
