Well, the modules it is not just a CLang thing, I think the ISO people are working on this. This will definitely be a major improvement for us developers of C/C++. And it will also improve the model of biicode, one of our major current problems is the preprocessor, one of the things that modules want to overcome. So if modules are really widely spread, together with biicode as dep manager with versions, which is quite orthogonal to modules, that could be possible the coolest dev ecosystem ever! :) :)]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much!<br
