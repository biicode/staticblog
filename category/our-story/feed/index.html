To make one&#8217;s source code dependent on any of them, just use #includes. Today biicode is releasing the source code of the client and the common services as part of a programmatic, comprehensive, full-on open source roadmap.</p><p>One of the biggest aims of biicode&#8217;s founders was to provide a useful and modern tool for the C and C++ communities. Because some of us believe that, despite the wonderful adoption and usage numbers of both programming languages, the current programming environment is not the best to address the challenges the software industry needs. We are trying to improve this landscape by providing a multi-language, cross-platform dependency manager that incorporates CMake as build system. A transversal, multipurpose, open source tool.</p><p>Fortunately for us, there is a vast community of open source advocates amongst the C and C++ developers. Thus our step forward by welcoming the C and C++ communities to our development efforts. We have now on our side a whole army of developers and thus we feel stronger. <strong>Much stronger</strong>.<br

class="aligncenter wp-image-2187 size-medium" title="Yikes! Come join us." src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Panal-baja-300x300.png" alt="biicode is open sourcing its code base starting of by it's brand new open source client" width="300" height="300" /></p><p><span
id="more-2177"></span></p><h2>The challenges ahead: biicode as an open source project</h2><p>Open sourcing software developed by a small start-up like us is not easy. Evidence says that, regardless of community adoption, it does not guarantee success at all. Just today, <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/the-real-reason-open-source-startups-fail/">TechCrunch raises awareness</a> on this regards. It is not only an important decision on which to reflect deeply but neither an easy path to tread on. For example, once the client is released we need to provide the appropriate structure for our community to collaborate and contribute conveniently; not an easy task for a small team overloaded with work.</p><p>We are however committed to do so. We said it in <a
href="https://opensource.com/business/15/1/biicode-open-source-dependency-manager">Opensource.com</a> and we say it here now again: <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">we will release progressively every part of biicode&#8217;s codebase</span>. Step by step, steadily and comprehensively. We know this bold move will provide us with a broader more supportive and collaborative community, an invaluable asset we can enrich with our know-how in dependency management, in software support and software consultancy.<br
/> We had already a steady user growth since mid 2014 but the announcement in Opensource.com boosted the pace as you can see below:</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2188 size-full" title="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Usersgraph.png" alt="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" width="694" height="497" /></p><p>However, not only our user base has grown, in fact the use of the tool has raised considerably. People are experimenting with the workflows and are eventually finding biicode useful to manage their dependencies.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2189 size-full" title="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/APIgraph.png" alt="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" width="655" height="471" /></p><p>This is just part of a larger open source strategy that will include every part of biicode&#8217;s code base and in a broader, more horizontal level we would like to follow <a
href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer</a>&#8216;s path and be completely transparent.<br
/> Because from now on and even before releasing the code, biicode belongs to its users. They have developed projects of many different kinds, providing such a quality feedback we cannot be grateful enough. There are game developers coding <a
href="http://small3d.org/biicodegame/">3D engines</a>, C++ devs trying <a
href="http://yacoder.net/blog/2015/04/05/boost-spirit-flatbuffers-catch-biicode-clion-github/">new technologies</a>, coders interested in <a
href="http://carlosvin.github.io/en/posts/first-biicode-poco.html">deps and package management</a>, keeping <a
href="http://zverovich.net/2014/12/30/using-cppformat-with-biicode.html">libs up-to-date</a> etc.</p><h2>Open source client and common services</h2><p><img

href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_San_Segundo_Carrillo">Pablo San Segundo</a> and I were pretty close to the one at the University the very first time Diego explained biicode to us.</p><p>I consider myself lucky for being part of biicode’s birth. The day we decided its name, or those endless meetings with a chalkboard full of diagrams, the first &#8220;battle logo&#8221; as we named our first &#8220;company mascot&#8221;.<br
/> In addition, I really enjoy my work as a university professor and engineer. Thanks to the university I have had the opportunity to devote myself to something that fascinated me since I was a child: robotics. But you cannot master robotics without solid programming skills, so I&#8217;ve been programming since I started hacking the fascinating Commodore 64, with its &#8220;peek&#8221; and &#8220;poke&#8221;, and his incredible voice synthesizer accessible through a simple command: &#8220;say&#8221;.</p><div

id="more-1626"></span></p><h2>Our story II</h2><p>I was barely 12 years old when my first computer game was published. By then, to share code with other rookie programmers you had to literally publish it in journals as pages and pages of text. So using other’s code implied a tedious and patient task of copying.<br
/> Not much has changed since then (except for the blessed CTRL-C and CTRL-V).</p><p>Two years later, I connected my old computer to an Scalextric so I was able to measure and display on the TV lap times, car speeds and lap counters, in addition to a sprite representation of the vehicles when crossing the finish line.</p><p>Then I made new friends who shared my hobby, and so, without giving up football, skates and bicycles, we reserved a place to pound the keys of a very first IBM PC, without a hard drive and with a neon yellow display that delights collectors right now.</p><p>After reading manuals and through hard trial and error, our programming skills evolved into learning new languages to achieve more complex functionalities to satisfy our requirements. BASIC, compiled QBASIC, PASCAL and Modula-2, were on our roadmap before discovering C and its amazing memory control.</p><p>So after making multiplayer games on CGA graphics cards (it’s amazing what you can achieve with only four basic colours!), EGA, VGA and XGA &#8230; constructing a pair of robotic arms and designing a series of more or less useful gadgets came &#8230; college.</p><h2>Instant byte crush</h2><p>I met Diego while I was doing my <a
href="http://www.elai.upm.es/joomla/index.php/webmaster/17-personal/personal-docente/57-webmaster">doctoral thesis</a> on supervisory control systems applied to the control of teleoperated robots over long distances. From the beginning I was surprised by Diego’s intellectual capacity and commitment to excellence. I remember when I asked him as part of his learning to develop a two-dimensional simulation of a solar system, and he delivered only a couple of days later, with a full configurable 3D simulator of a complex celestial system.<br
/> Increasingly, we were collaborating on more projects together of both: research and teaching, supporting each other with our particular vision of things. We both enjoy trying to introduce common sense reasoning in machines and software, and many of our discussions were about simplifying the robots processing into the same categories of our way of thinking. So while Diego was working on the interpretation of environment data for robot localization and mapping, I was trying to include spatial reasoning skills on the control of robot manipulators.<br
/> <img
class="alignleft wp-image-1629" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/MVC-476X.jpg" alt="Some of the founders of biicode at the beginning of our story" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>So, in 2011 we came up with an ambitious project: we started to develop lightweight C++ library (MRCore) that was meant to support our respective investigations.<br
/> The code we generated was based on many pieces of old code, or third parties that we integrated into our scheme, so Diego began mulling over the idea of ​​permanently interconnect these functions in the cloud.<br
/> Consequently, one day at the University lounge, he exposed to Pablo and me the main ideas of something he called &#8220;Hypercode&#8221; in its most original form. He said then that we had to extend the concept of internet hyperlink to the software, so that a piece of code could use another piece of code without having to copy and manage the duplicate.</p><blockquote><p>Just like Wikipedia</p></blockquote><p>he said</p><blockquote><p>if you need to use any piece of code just link it</p></blockquote><p>Diego&#8217;s proposal fascinated me. His idea was a breath of fresh air, it had a clear goal and was accompanied by ambition and high potential.<br
/> After a dozen national and international research projects, I was still copying and adapting the same code to perform the same mathematical operations, the same simulations, the same port handlers, etc.<br
/> In many cases, I grouped functionalities into libraries and I tried to maintain and update them, but for other functionalities I still had a lot pieces of code repeated again and again with small and no relevant changes among them.</p><h2>A C and C++ dependencies manager, <strong>finally</strong>!</h2><p>How many times have I written the code to manage correctly the TCP/UDP client/server? Or to establish message protocols for communication between components? Or the robust, secure and non-blocking way of handling of a serial port?<br
/> The idea of ​​developing a dependency manager for C / C ++ was evolving gradually and improving towards a much more complete vision about what the software programming should be with a pragmatist view.<br
/> We started to enrich the basic idea with Internet’s magic and the Open Source movement and enthused with it.<br
/> And bit by bit all the pieces start fitting together into an ambitious and beautiful picture. Diego’s thrust, courage and ability were the main ingredients that propelled us and our story into building a new programming paradigm: biicode.</p><div

We hope this gives you a hint of the pains and gains of creating a start-up from scratch. This is our story.</p><h2>Why I quit a tenure track position as professor</h2><p>I&#8217;m <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/diegorlosada/">Diego Rodriguez-Losada</a>, the first promoter of biicode and one of its founders. Right before embracing this adventure, I had a comfortable position as a professor in Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.</p><div

id="more-994"></span></p><p>I had been working very hard many years before and after my PhD: publishing research papers in top ranked journals, leading projects, etc. I had recently obtained my tenure track position, I was the first to do so in my department and probably the youngest in my college. I had also recently had my third child. I knew I was smart and I was also confident with my solid background, but compared to some of the brilliant and talented people I met during those years I felt merely mediocre. Meeting in conferences with some of the best brains in my area (Robotics), like S. Thrun or P. Newman was amazing, but realizing that even the local and much younger than me Spanish talents such as <a
href="http://www.ual.es/~jlblanco/">J. L. Blanco</a> were far more capable than me, was simultaneously frustrating and inspiring.</p><h3>Motivation</h3><p>This inspiration motivated me to join the open source movement. I started to release our C/C++ research code, working together with my friends M. Hernando (my former advisor) and A. Valero (former colleague, now an openHW and 3D printers master in BQ). We had a lot of trouble managing dependencies and I wondered about the absence of a good multi-OS dependencies manager for C/C++. I love C/C++, but it made me jealous how languages like python managed so easily to dependencies on third party code (e.g. just the simple task to use a serial port in any OS). Why couldn&#8217;t this be done in C/C++? Why libraries are so huge in C/C++, forcing one to use the whole library even for a simple task? Why one of the most used languages (up to 20% of the world source code) does not have a dependency manager?</p><blockquote><p>Why couldn&#8217;t this be done in C/C++? Why libraries are so huge in C/C++, forcing one to use the whole library even for a simple task? Why one of the most used languages (up to 20% of the world source code) does not have a dependency manager?</p></blockquote><p>So I imagined a simple dependency manager for C/C++ that completely avoided packaging and, at the same time, was able to reuse individual source code files easily. I even realized that such an approach could be great for every language, as exactly the same procedure for publishing, reusing, handling dependencies and conflicts for every language sound the proper approach to the problem. This however is yet a very abstract and probably naïve approach on the matter since dependency managers already exist for other languages and it is almost impossible to compete with them.</p><h2>Let&#8217;s go!</h2><p>I made some initial research to check that indeed nobody was building or trying to build something similar to this idea. And I decided that I could try to build it. How could I even dare think I could be able to build such a system? Why in heaven would I have any chance of succeeding in such a complex and challenging project?</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Mo5.com</p></div><p>Those questions drove me back in time to my early teens, when I was a top student in school, and probably the typical nerd that built miniaturized fm radio emitters with my homemade PCBs (using acids, the reason why my mother was not very happy about it), and programmed videogames in our Amstrad CPC6128 instead of playing them. Those years I learnt that in technology, everything is possible: it is not necessary to be a genius, just smart enough and have a clear goal and ambition, have discipline and commitment and people you can learn from. And I learnt to love challenges. The PhD, the tenure track position… are probably partly just the consequence of that love.</p><p>As you can guess, I decided to quit my position (the first professor to do so and the only one until today in my University) and run my startup: biicode, where we are building this system, and I am enjoying an ecosystem of brilliant (more than me, as usual) developers and software engineers, that are also challenge-hungry and willing to learn. And we are very close to show that this technological challenge is, indeed, also possible. There is only a missing piece, a different kind of challenge I have possible underestimated: the community. This deserves a dedicated post, so stay tuned :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This story continues with Miguel Hernando&#8217;s memories of where everything started. Find the second episode <a
