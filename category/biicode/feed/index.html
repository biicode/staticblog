Fortunately, as the title says, it is only the company what is in trouble, biicode as a product/technology is at the moment in good health and operating properly. However, in our commitment of transparency with our users and stakeholders in general, we think it is important to let you know.</p><p>Biicode is a great project, but it is also a startup, a business. That means that we hired people to develop the platform, and expected that at some point our revenue would be able to pay that people and also hopefully generate some profit. But it didn’t. We have been running on our investors money plus some public government loans for the last years, and we have been able to develop what we think is an amazing technology. We were running out of cash, so we started to work on a new funding round well in advance. But finally we were not able to close it, and now our expenses and burn rate are not sustainable anymore, so we must continue without employees and face a new stage that will most probably mean closing the company.</p><p>As a startup we have made many of the errors a startup typically makes. An important one was probably that our technology was a bit opinionated about software engineering processes, and we failed to adequately and timely listen (that means also filtering out lots of noise) to user feedback. Even if we realized it almost a year ago and started to make huge changes to the platform through our 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 releases, that was not enough.</p><p>We were able to gather lots of users love from the open source community, and blog posts talking nicely about us started to flourish since last November’14, so we were able to grow about 25% month over month in activity (measured in API-calls to our server, that means, people actually using the tools to code with them), for the last 6 months.</p><p>But still, our total number of registered users was not as large as expected (now reaching 4000), and the most important reason: we failed to upsell the service and get enough premium paying customers. Practically all of the above activity was from open source users. But production C/C++ development can be quite different from other technologies, projects are very large, and introducing biicode in those projects is quite a time investment, and timings for new projects and introducing new technologies can be large too. Too large for a startup, even this technology could be a great business for a bigger corporation with more time and resources. We understand this can be a major concern for prospective investors, so we certainly do not blame on the VC ecosystem (in this case the Spanish/EU one) neither have we thought that our luck would be different in the USA.</p><p>I will write soon more detailed posts about all the many lessons learned in this startup adventure, but a very important one I don’t want to skip here is to acknowledge and be grateful. First I want to thanks the biicode team (you can find most of them http://web.biicode.com/meet-the-team/), especially those that have been “bleeding” with me the last months: Luis (Laso), David, Fran, Maria, Jordi, Manu and Miguel. Thanks for your passion, support, friendship, and the indecent amount of extra work hours. You are the best team a tech startup can dream of.</p><p>Many thanks to our investors Big Sur Ventures &#8211; Necotium and Fundacion Jose Manuel Entrecanales, who believed in biicode and have supported us for so long. They have both been great investors, but I want to give very special thanks to Jose Miguel Herrero, our lead investor from Big Sur Ventures &#8211; Necotium, for his incredible support and commitment. KPIs, go to market, strategy, funding, hiring,…  Even these tough days, when you get to know the real values of the people around you, we have learned so much from him thanks to his continuous involvement and support. If you have a great project looking for funding here in Spain or even Europe and you are not pitching Jose Miguel you are definitely missing an incredible opportunity.</p><p>And finally, you, our users: I don’t have words to say thanks enough. You have supported us, invest your time to help us improve thanks to your feedback, comments and suggestions. You have used biicode for your libraries and your projects, making our dream of such a tool a reality. Many of you have even said that you love it.  We were C and C++ developers, and seeing other colleagues use biicode and loving it is the best reward we could have, and you gave it to us. I am very sorry we have not managed to fully guarantee its survival in its current form.</p><p>But we have not given up, fortunately, biicode as a project/technology is alive, and even if our resources are lower, there are still hundreds of active users enjoying it. We have released a full stack as open source (MIT license), including a server you can host on premises. It still lacks a web interface, but is fully operational and can be managed with little “devops”, and having an open-source web interface is a matter of time. The central biicode servers, site and web are fully operational, and they will be for at least 6 months more, probably 1 year if possible. We will personally continue to operate and support them (up to the legal limits). What the future will be, nobody knows. We believe that it is a good moment for the community to take over and start to see biicode as ours, a project of the C/C++ developer’s community, and hopefully together we will find the way for it.</p><p>So this is not a goodbye, just the beginning of a new stage for biicode. See you there and thanks again for everything.</p><p>Diego<br

href="https://www.biicode.com/miguel/sdl2">SDL</a>, <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/diego/glfw">OpenGL</a> or <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/dimitrikourk/small3d">small3D</a>, a requested and valuable feature is adding sound effects, raising alarms or creating new atmospheres. With this feature in mind and thanks to the work of <a
href="http://www.fmod.org/">FMOD</a> and <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/miguel">Miguel Hernando</a> we announce today a new block that incorporates all the functionality to your project: <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/miguel/easysound">EasySound</a>.</p><h2>What does fmod do?</h2><p>EasySound wraps the main functionality of the low-level fmod api and can deal with different kinds of sound files and formats: <em>mp3</em>, <em>wav</em>, <em>ogg</em>. FMOD is an audio tool developed by <a
href="http://www.fmod.org/about-us/">Firelight Technologies</a> focused on the development of professional video games. It has been used in over 2000 games and has integration with well-known game engines such as <a
href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> or <a
href="https://unity3d.com/">Havok</a>.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2264 size-full" title="fmod developed by Firelight Technologies" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/fmod.jpg" alt="fmod logo" width="477" height="213" /></p><p>At <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/miguel/easysound">EasySound block</a>, there is a simple class called <span
style="text-decoration: underline">EasyPlayer</span> which is a very straightforward way to handle sounds.</p><p><span
id="more-2262"></span></p><h2>Developing a Virtual Player</h2><p>We&#8217;ll develop a simple application using EasySound to make a virtual player with your keyboard, similar to sound keyboards used for live radio streams. This application uses SDL to show the simplicity of incorporating sounds into a game. It also handles key interruptions from keyboard making this project multi-platform compatible.</p><p>To start this new project create a block with the simple layout and place a <strong>main.cpp</strong> inside:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ bii init easysound_example -L
$ cd easysound_example
$ # create main.cpp</pre><p>Now it&#8217;s time to create a new folder called &#8220;sounds&#8221; with plenty of sound files inside. You can find some sound effects <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/miguel/test_easysound">here</a> or use whatever you want. Add them to your <em>biicode.con</em>f <strong>[data]</strong> section, to create a link to the main file with your sound files.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">[data]
    main.cpp + sounds/wave.mp3 sounds/drumloop.wav sounds/d.ogg</pre><p>NOTE: Add a cool png image for the background of your app.</p><p>This way the sounds folder is copied to <em>bin/your_user/easysound_example/sounds/&#8230; </em>So you have to follow this path to refer to your sounds in your code.</p><p>Add some code to your <strong>main.cpp</strong>:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#include "miguel/sdl_utils/SDLUsimpleGLApp.h"
#include "miguel/easysound/EasyPlayer.h"
#include "stdio.h"
class VirtualPlayer: public SDLUsimpleGLApp
{
  EasyPlayer myplayer;
  void onKeyboardDown(SDL_KeyboardEvent k)
  {
    switch(k.keysym.sym)
    {
      case SDLK_0:
        myplayer.playSound("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/jaguar.wav");
        break;
      case SDLK_1:
        myplayer.playMusic("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/swish.wav");
        break;
      case SDLK_2:
        myplayer.playSound("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/c.ogg");
        break;
      case SDLK_3:
        myplayer.playMusic("Dani_MTB/easysound_exampe/sounds/drumloop.wav");

        myplayer.playSound("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/d.ogg");
        break;
      case SDLK_5:
        myplayer.playMusic("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/e.ogg");
        break;
      case SDLK_6:
        myplayer.playSound("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/singing.wav");
        break;
      case SDLK_7:
        myplayer.playMusic("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/standrews.wav");
        break;
      case SDLK_8:
        myplayer.playSound("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/stereo.ogg");
	break;
      case SDLK_9:
        myplayer.playMusic("Dani_MTB/easysound_example/sounds/wave.mp3");
        break;
    }
  }
  bool setup()

    SDLUsimpleGLApp::loop();
  }
} vPlayer;
#ifdef __cplusplus

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  vPlayer.execute();
  return 0;
}</pre><p>Build your project:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ bii build
$ cd bin
$ # execute it</pre><p>As you can see, we just assigned sounds to the number keys on the keyboard. So just press the desired key and sound will come out immediately. You can play sounds simultaneously and create virtual effects. It is a great idea for musicians to create new atmospheres for their songs!</p><h2>Open and build</h2><p>I have developed my own virtual player, so just check <a

href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode/">open source project</a> we launched a while back a our <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">Darth Vader++ campaign</a> in which anyone that uploaded any piece of code to our cloud and had it reused by any other user would receive for free our Darth Vader++ t-shirt. The campaign has been a huge success, many libs and frameworks have been uploaded and  most importantly reused in other projects. The campaign has put in contact many lib authors with people that have reused their code in ways they could not expect. Some other times, users just asked the authors or maintainers for use cases of their code and followed up with an example. Creating community, that&#8217;s what all this is about.</p><p><img

The latter has evolved and added such degrees of complexity that the legal support for the users and the company needed a rethink and a rephrasing to say the least. And that&#8217;s exactly what we did: after consulting with our legal counselors and talking to companies that provide similar services, we have revamped the ToS, check the new ones <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.</p><p><img
class=" wp-image-1597 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/terms-of-service.jpg" alt="biicode's new Terms of service" width="800" height="197" /></p><h2></h2><p><span
id="more-2191"></span></p><h2>A few things about the new Terms of Service</h2><p>The aforementioned degrees of complexity can be listed as follows:</p><ul><li>Going open source</li><li>User code licensing</li><li>Deletion of accounts</li><li>Free and Premium accounts</li></ul><h3>Open Source</h3><p>biicode just announced the release of its code (read more <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-client/">here</a>), thus the new ToS take this new reality into consideration. In fact, alongside the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and the licence under which the user&#8217;s code is, these ToS guide the usage of the tools. Therefor their importance is capital and, as you can see we do not modify them carelessly or unadvisedly; on the contrary we welcome your input and we try as much as possible to be developer friendly. We support as much as we can the C and C++ communities.</p><h3>Licence</h3><p>We have released both the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/client/blob/develop/LICENSE">client</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/common/blob/develop/LICENSE">common services</a> of biicode under <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT licence</a>. We believe this license gives free space for anyone to fork, modify, merge etc. biicode&#8217;s code and thus experiment or even create with it new products. Again, we&#8217;d love to see the C and C++ community blossom with tools that conform a modern programming environment.</p><p>Another aspect of the licensing of code affects the code supported (uploaded to) biicode&#8217;s cloud. We have also modified this application of the ToS in favour of easily licensing user. If no licence is indicated, full copyright protection is granted to the user that uploaded the code except for biicode&#8217;s Minimum Required Licence required to provide the services of access and query to other user&#8217;s of the code uploaded to free accounts, i.e. to show it in the our site.</p><p>All of biicode&#8217;s users will be informed of these changes in an email to come in the next few days.</p><p>Anyway, please take a look at the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">new ToS</a> and tell us what you think. We welcome your feedback and input.</p><p>The post <a

To make one&#8217;s source code dependent on any of them, just use #includes. Today biicode is releasing the source code of the client and the common services as part of a programmatic, comprehensive, full-on open source roadmap.</p><p>One of the biggest aims of biicode&#8217;s founders was to provide a useful and modern tool for the C and C++ communities. Because some of us believe that, despite the wonderful adoption and usage numbers of both programming languages, the current programming environment is not the best to address the challenges the software industry needs. We are trying to improve this landscape by providing a multi-language, cross-platform dependency manager that incorporates CMake as build system. A transversal, multipurpose, open source tool.</p><p>Fortunately for us, there is a vast community of open source advocates amongst the C and C++ developers. Thus our step forward by welcoming the C and C++ communities to our development efforts. We have now on our side a whole army of developers and thus we feel stronger. <strong>Much stronger</strong>.<br

id="more-2177"></span></p><h2>The challenges ahead: biicode as an open source project</h2><p>Open sourcing software developed by a small start-up like us is not easy. Evidence says that, regardless of community adoption, it does not guarantee success at all. Just today, <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/the-real-reason-open-source-startups-fail/">TechCrunch raises awareness</a> on this regards. It is not only an important decision on which to reflect deeply but neither an easy path to tread on. For example, once the client is released we need to provide the appropriate structure for our community to collaborate and contribute conveniently; not an easy task for a small team overloaded with work.</p><p>We are however committed to do so. We said it in <a
href="https://opensource.com/business/15/1/biicode-open-source-dependency-manager">Opensource.com</a> and we say it here now again: <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">we will release progressively every part of biicode&#8217;s codebase</span>. Step by step, steadily and comprehensively. We know this bold move will provide us with a broader more supportive and collaborative community, an invaluable asset we can enrich with our know-how in dependency management, in software support and software consultancy.<br
/> We had already a steady user growth since mid 2014 but the announcement in Opensource.com boosted the pace as you can see below:</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2188 size-full" title="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Usersgraph.png" alt="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" width="694" height="497" /></p><p>However, not only our user base has grown, in fact the use of the tool has raised considerably. People are experimenting with the workflows and are eventually finding biicode useful to manage their dependencies.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2189 size-full" title="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/APIgraph.png" alt="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" width="655" height="471" /></p><p>This is just part of a larger open source strategy that will include every part of biicode&#8217;s code base and in a broader, more horizontal level we would like to follow <a
href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer</a>&#8216;s path and be completely transparent.<br
/> Because from now on and even before releasing the code, biicode belongs to its users. They have developed projects of many different kinds, providing such a quality feedback we cannot be grateful enough. There are game developers coding <a
href="http://small3d.org/biicodegame/">3D engines</a>, C++ devs trying <a
href="http://yacoder.net/blog/2015/04/05/boost-spirit-flatbuffers-catch-biicode-clion-github/">new technologies</a>, coders interested in <a
href="http://carlosvin.github.io/en/posts/first-biicode-poco.html">deps and package management</a>, keeping <a
href="http://zverovich.net/2014/12/30/using-cppformat-with-biicode.html">libs up-to-date</a> etc.</p><h2>Open source client and common services</h2><p><img

/> Everything you need to know about biicode&#8217;s client release is in the <a
href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode">GitHub page</a> we have built to host all of our open source project. We welcome you on board and hope to see every single bug captured and fixed, any possible security issue reported and solved and great features and improvements being PR&#8217;ed!</p><p><a

We seek not only collaboration but also guidance. Please let us know where you want the tool to aim. Tell us about your issues when coding and how biicode could come in handy. Join us to provide C and C++ with a better programming environment.</p><h3><strong>The future is yours</strong></h3><p>These are just some of the things we believe a better C and C++ dependency manager should have and that we are already working on (check our <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/community/roadmap/">roadmap</a> to know more about them):</p><ul><li>Connect and host directly to git, zip and other origins</li><li>Support for bigger files</li><li>Better support for binary artifacts</li><li>Social, communication, popularity indices, etc</li><li>Android and other toolchains (Emscripten) support</li><li>Release of an open source in-house server</li><li>AND MANY MORE!</li></ul><p>But the future of this tool is intimately connected to the communities’ will. We want to hear your opinions, lead the way, suggest features and make biicode evolve with you as developers. We are <strong>here to serve C and C++</strong>.</p><p><img

href="http://blog.biicode.com/maximum-clique-for-massive-sparse-graphs/">previous post</a> has raised a number of comments, some even questioning either the report itself or the problem’s complexity. This post gives an insight on how BBMCSP works. In the process, and similar to what happens when magicians explain their tricks, we are aware that some of the magic will be lost.</p><p><span
id="more-2164"></span></p><p>BBMCSP’s overarching ideas are described in the pseudocode below:</p><h2><strong>BBMCSP: an exact maximum clique algorithm</strong></h2><p><em>Input</em>: A simple graph G(V, E)<br
/> <em>Output</em>: A maximum clique in G in S<sub>max</sub></p><ol><li>Compute k-core decomposition of G: K(G)</li><li>Compute an initial clique greedily: S<sub>max</sub></li><li>Remove vertices from G such that K(v)&lt;|S<sub>max</sub>|: G<sub>r </sub>(V<sub>r</sub>, E<sub>r</sub>)</li><li>Sort V<sub>r</sub> according to degeneracy</li><li>Iteratively branch on vertices in Vr in reverse order: v</li><li>|    Compute subproblem derived from v: W ⊆ V<sub>r</sub></li><li>|    Compute a greedy coloring of W : C(W). <strong>if</strong> |C(W)|&lt; |S<sub>max</sub>| <strong>return</strong></li><li>|    Compute k-core decomposition of W : K(W).<strong> if</strong> |K(W)|&lt; |S<sub>max</sub>| <strong>return</strong></li><li>|    Remove vertices w from W such that K(w)&lt;|S<sub>max</sub>|: W’</li><li>|    Sort W’ according to degeneracy</li><li>|    SEARCH for a maximum clique in W’ with BBMC sparse solver : S<sub>max</sub></li><li>|_ Remove v from V<sub>r</sub></li><li><strong>return</strong> S<sub>max</sub></li></ol><h3><strong> STEP BY STEP</strong></h3><p>All steps except 11 constitute preprocessing tailored for massive graphs. Core hierarchical decomposition in step 1 is a must for any decent graph software package. Each k-core determines a maximal subgraph with the property that all its vertices have degree at least k (cf. <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/maximum-clique-for-massive-sparse-graphs/">previous post</a>). Thus, the core number of a vertex is the order the highest core which contains it and the core number of the graph is the order of its highest core.  Note that, in the case of real graphs, the core number is usually much lower than the maximum degree of the graph—e.g. in networks with a power law distribution only a few individuals are massively connected—. Step 3 removes vertices that cannot possibly improve the initial greedy clique in S<sub>max</sub> because of a low core number. After that vertices are sorted in step 4 according to degeneracy, i.e. non increasing core number.</p><p>Step 5 is the main loop which may be regarded as a first level unrolling of the search tree of a typical exact solver. For each vertex v picked in reverse order, the child subproblem—its neighbor set— is also preprocessed trying to produce an early cut. Step 7 is concerned with approximate color cuts, i.e. the current best solution in S<sub>max</sub> cannot be improved by any subproblem in which a coloring of size less than | S<sub>max</sub>|.  Moreover, Step 8 prunes the subproblem if its core number is less than| S<sub>max</sub>|.  Finally, if the subproblem cannot be pruned directly in the previous two steps, concrete vertices are removed when their core number is less than | S<sub>max</sub>| in step 9. Remaining vertices are sorted by degeneracy in step 10.</p><p>The actual NP-hard search occurs in step 11 over the filtered subproblem W&#8217;. BBMCSP uses the exact bitstring solver BBMC tailored for large or massive graphs by a specifically designed sparse encoding, as mentioned in the alluded <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/maximum-clique-for-massive-sparse-graphs/">previous post</a>.</p><h3><strong>AN EXAMPLE</strong></h3><div

class="wp-image-2169 size-large" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/GraphExample-1024x585.png" alt="An example of a graph being used to solve the exact maximum clique problem." width="630" height="360" /><p
class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. A Graph example. Label notation &lt;x:y:z&gt; denotes vertex index, kcore and degree respectively</p></div><p>Figure 1 contains a simple graph G of order 10 &#8211;notation for node labels x:y:x is <em>x</em> for index, <em>y</em> for kcore number and <em>z</em> for degree&#8211;. The graph core number K(G) is 4 and its maximum degree is 6 (given by vertex 6). Step 2 of the algorithm finds an initial greedy clique | S<sub>max</sub>| of  3 so vertices 1 and 5 are explicitly removed  from G in step 3. The remaining vertices are ordered according to degeneracy in step 4 (see figure 1, left).</p><p>Figure 2 below contains the resulting behaviour of BBMCSP in the main loop (steps 5-12), which includes the first level unrolling and the actual NP-hard search. Vertices are picked in reverse order (header <em>v</em>) and, after each iteration, removed from G<sub>r </sub>. The first iteration in the loop calls vertex 8 and analyses subproblem W={2, 3, 5, 7}. The vertex coloring C(W)  has color size 3, same as   | S<sub>max</sub>| so the subproblem cannot be pruned at step 7. The subproblem <em>is </em>pruned, however, in step 8 by core analysis. Subsequently vertex 8 is removed and vertex 7 startsa new iteration (second row).</p><p>The critical step occurs when vertex 6 is chosen, which contains a maximum clique {1, 2, 4, 6}. In this case the entire subproblem cannot obviously be pruned so vertex 9 is reached and vertex 5 is removed since K(5) is lower than | S<sub>max</sub>|. The search routine is finally called in step 11 and the clique si found. Remaining vertices in G<sub>r </sub>are pruned more or less trivially thereafter.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. BBMCSP steps 5-12</p></div><h3><strong>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</strong></h3><p>K-core analysis is critical during preprocessing. If the reader wants to implement it by himself we warn him that the typical solution runs in O(|V|<sup>2</sup>) which is not adequate for large or massive sparse graphs. We recommend the O(|E|) algorithm of <a
href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/doc/cores/cores.pdf">Bagatelij</a>—the  implementation used by BBMCSP can be found in the <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/graph">pablodev/graph</a> block in the Biicode repo—. A side result is that vertices are also sorted according to degeneracy, which is necessary for steps 4 and 10 as explained.</p><p>A sequential greedy coloring in step 7 assigns, to each vertex in turn, the lowest possible color label consistent with the current partial coloring. The bitstring implementation employed by BBMCSP may be found in the <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/copt">pablodev/copt</a> block (<em>InitColor</em> class).</p><p>Additionally, the sparse encoding used by BBMC is available as part of the BITSCAN library—<a
href="https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/bitscan">pablodev/bitscan</a> block— and the GRAPH library—pablodev/graph— block. BBMCSP uses the sparse_graph available in GRAPH and currently most of the source code is also available in the pablodev/copt block.</p><h4><strong>A NOTE ON COMPLEXITY</strong></h4><p>In reply to the comments of some of our readers, maximum clique is <em>still</em> NP-hard, yes, and uniform graphs of say a thousand vertices and 0.8 density remain a very difficult challenge for today’s best exact solvers. The reason why BBMCSP is so successful lies mainly on the structure of real networks, which is typically much simplified after the heavy tailored preprocessing described.</p><p>That this is so can be seen in the following example: the California road network <em>roadNet-CA</em> with 1.9 million nodes, 2.7 million edges and a clique number of 4 was trivially solved in less than a second of preprocessing by BBMCSP—step 11, the NP-hard search step, is actually never called—. The same graph was proposed as benchmark in a recent Big Data Conference [1]. There it took 153 seconds to solve using 75 processor nodes!</p><p>Raw results of <a
href="http://venus.elai.upm.es/logs/results_sparse/bin/">BMCSP </a>against more than 200 real networks, as well as results of state-of-the-art algorithms are available <a
href="http://venus.elai.upm.es/logs/results_sparse/">here</a>. We are currently working on a heavy refactoring and a more sophisticated command line parameter interface both for Windows and Linux binaries. As always, we await comments and suggestions from readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[1] Hagan, R.

They are also by far the oldest languages of the current mainstream ones, used in key industries and even increasingly due to synergies with other fields as the IoT/embedded systems or robotics, in which these languages are important.</p><p>C++ is a great language, and it is improving faster than ever with the recent 11 and 14 standards, and 17 is very promising too. It is amazing how the syntax is becoming closer and closer to other more “modern” languages as python. And C is the solid foundation of most current IT technology. State of the art compilers, optimizers, debuggers and IDEs for C and C++ are excellent.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">C and C++ make up to 20% of the world code</p></div><p><span
id="more-2156"></span></p><p>But then, one day you want to write some simple portable and reusable code that is able to send <code>Hello World</code> characters over a serial port.</p><p>Ask a <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">pythonist</span>. He will write <code>$ pip install pyserial</code>, and in a few minutes he will have the solution.</p><p>Ask a <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">C++ dev</span>. The first surprise is that there is no such pyserial equivalent in C++. And C++ is allegedly very good at low level. The closest thing could be the serial port inside Boost.Asio (which is the most voted answer in StackOverflow), but just downloading Boost could take more time than the python solution, and it also requires the serial port to be used in an asynchronous framework, which is probably overkill for this task. The proof is that hundreds of files will typically be included in this simple job. Furthermore the C++ coder will typically have to manually introduce the include paths or equivalent in their project.</p><p>In contrast, the python pyserial has a few files, and the funniest thing is that most part of it is actually written in simple C. Creating a reusable component for this serial “Hello World” will take even more effort, and the process of installing Boost will have to be repeated on every new computer.</p><p>In no way I pretend to say that Boost is bad code, <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">it is brilliant</span>, but it is clear that in the C and C++ development processes large inefficiencies are still present.</p><p>The motto <em>don’t pay for what you don’t use</em> is certainly true in terms of the potential of the languages and the achievable computational resources efficiency, but totally misleading in terms of the development process. This process is less efficient in C and C++ compared to other languages. And <a
href="http://tech.co/highest-paying-programming-languages-2015-03">C++ is the highest-paying programming language</a>. This means, in C and C++ we, as developers, have to pay for a precious time that does not generate value into our products, wasted time that creates a competitive disadvantage with respect to our colleagues or ourselves developing in other languages.</p><p>So the biggest problem is not languages themselves, but the development tools and ecosystem around them. First, <b>the build system</b> is a complete diaspora of different compilers with different options and libraries, but what is worst, different build systems not only among OSs, but also among compilers.</p><p>Fortunately in this case <strong>CMake</strong><b> </b>comes to the rescue. It is not strictly a build system, but a layer over them, generating native builds for different targets. CMake is the de-facto standard for multi-OS projects, and it is also getting more adoption even for single OS projects. It is mature and powerful, and keeps improving very fast. New projects as the cool CLion IDE, directly use CMake as the only supported build system, and it is a good approach. Although  the scripting syntax could be better, the consensus is far more important than any other factor, and I think that the C and C++ communities’ universal adoption of CMake would be a great win for everybody, and pray to the God of Bits to find a CMakeLists.txt in every project.</p><p>Secondly but even more important is <b>the lack of a C and/or C++ dependency manager</b><b>.</b> Python has pip, Java has Maven, Node has NPM, Ruby has bundler, Go has get, Rust has cargo… And no, apt or similar are not  dependency managers, otherwise those languages wouldn’t feature their own dependencies managers. This will be the ultimate cause of the sunset of C and C++ languages, which will be reduced to the very core components in a few years, just as assembler is today.</p><h3><strong>The real menace: Rust and Go</strong></h3><p>Because interpreted and dynamic languages keep evolving, virtual machines and advances in JIT compiling are producing amazing results in terms of speed, as in PyPy, and some of the best technologies that support the C and C++ ecosystems as LLVM also nurture those languages tools. But the <b>real menace comes from modern compiled languages like Go or Rust</b>, which have the advantages of decades of learning in computing languages and no legacy codebases to keep supporting. Not only for the language syntax itself, which can have very convenient features (easy, concurrency, safety…) but also for the ease with which dependencies are managed. Simple deps management creates virtuous circles with exponential growths. You can easily build with Rust or Go apps, libraries or systems, just by declaring or importing the GUI, network, AI, graphics, server, serialization, ORM libraries, etc., you want to integrate in your project. Despite C or C++ could hypothetically get further performance, setting up an equivalent project can take much, much longer to complete in C or C++.</p><p><b>No matter how much the languages are improved, as long as this problem is not fixed, future looks gloomy for my beloved C and C++ languages</b>. Develop an ecosystem in which this is possible, and they will not only not decline, but even take over in less traditional domains such as web apps and mobile.</p><p>If you have read so far, you are most probably a smart developer, and you have realized that <b>this post is on biicode’s blog during our open source challenge, and this post is nothing but f***ing marketing with an intended-to-be catchy title to get your attention. I am sorry, it is. </b>However the above still holds true, I meant every word, the menace is real, and I am not trying to cheat you by saying that biicode is the solution or the lifesaver of the C and C++ languages. It is marketing about a team of people really committed to try to help in the development of whatever the C and C++ communities require.</p><p>We have been doing large improvements in biicode versions from 1.0 to 2.7, based on your feedback: plain-text configuration, flexible project layouts, avoid modifications of #includes… you name it, we do our best to address it.</p><p>And you have consistently <b>requested it to be Open Source</b>, that is why, after negotiating with our investors we launched our <a
href="http://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">challenge</a>. With this announcement and the latest improvements based on your feedback biicode is finally gaining a decent traction and we got our first clients even before launching the premium accounts publicly.
