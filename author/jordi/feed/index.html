href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode/">open source project</a> we launched a while back a our <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">Darth Vader++ campaign</a> in which anyone that uploaded any piece of code to our cloud and had it reused by any other user would receive for free our Darth Vader++ t-shirt. The campaign has been a huge success, many libs and frameworks have been uploaded and  most importantly reused in other projects. The campaign has put in contact many lib authors with people that have reused their code in ways they could not expect. Some other times, users just asked the authors or maintainers for use cases of their code and followed up with an example. Creating community, that&#8217;s what all this is about.</p><p><img

style="text-decoration: underline;">first corporate client</span> (yay!). Elecnor Deimos is a top tech company with over 500 engineers in staff. They provide software solutions for different sectors ranging from aerospace and aeronautics and defense to transportation or telecommunications in a EU and worldwide levels. The relevance of their clients is descriptive of the quality of their products and services; a few of them are <b>ESA</b> (European Space Agency), <b>NASA</b>, <b>European Union</b>, <b>Telefónica</b>, <b>Siemens</b>, <b>Nokia</b>&#8230;<br
/> For all these top-level companies they develop a huge variety of products like Satellite imagery, air navigation systems, environmental managing systems etc. All of which are top-knotch pieces of software. But what&#8217;s even better for their clients is that Elecnor Deimos is making a bold move to support and use modern technologies like <a
href="https://www.biicode.com">biicode</a> or <a
href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> as we&#8217;ll explain later. This could only mean that a thriving software company is not only keeping its gained quality standards but also expanding their horizons into new sectors and technologies. Never stop moving!</p><p><img
class=" size-large wp-image-2206 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/elecDeimosColor-1024x498.png" alt="Elecnor deimos" width="630" height="306" /></p><p><span
id="more-2205"></span></p><h2>How can biicode help Elecnor Deimos in software development?</h2><p>Elecnor Deimos has a <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">humongous amount of code developed in C and C++</span>. Anyone that has managed, coordinated or simply worked in such an environment knows perfectly how hard finding something can be. Especially when ongoing ideas or code samples are not packaged and thus not ready to be reused easily. If we add to this the fact that no external libs were being called and thus any required lib was <strong>hardcoded</strong> to any given project you&#8217;ll make an idea of how complicated finding <strong>specific code snippets</strong> is. It&#8217;s basically <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">a pain in the neck for everyday coding</span>.<br
/> This was at first, Elecnor Deimos&#8217; idea: to have a biicode <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/pricing/">premium account</a> to which upload and support interesting C and C++ libs and frameworks &#8211; compatible with <strong>Subversion</strong> VCS. Eventually thay would become useful and would be searched and found in the brink of a <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/explore">query</a>. In the long run, their private account will be so populated with code that basically anything required in <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">any new project would be one #include away</span>.</p><h2><strong>Prototyping</strong>: the key start to successful software</h2><p>When a software company is successful it wins more and more clients which means eventually more and more projects. That&#8217;s precisely what has happened to Elecnor Deimos: founded barely 14 years ago by twenty intrepid engineers, it is now a multinational with presence in Spain, Portugal, UK and Romania and over 500 engineers in staff to deliver credited quality services.<br
/> Scaling resources to address the challenges that such a growth represents is not easy at all. Programmers in particular need to be more efficient and learn quick from previous experience. One of the skills most senior devs tend to point out as the one that summarizes better all there experience in the job is prototyping. When project specifications are described a good programmer starts sketching it&#8217;s layout and challenges. Once this is properly done <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">quick solutions can be essayed</span>; why not? At this precise moment of the project it is not only cheap but wise to fail. All sorts of hypothesis and procedures to solve the problem pop up and a quick prototype serves well to try a solution to them. biicode is the perfect match for this methodology. Read more about how to prototype with <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/zeromq-cpp-biicode/">biicode in our example using ZeroMQ</a>.<br
/> Fostering <strong>code discovery</strong>, <strong>quick prototyping</strong> and <strong>easy integration</strong> are the basic goodies anyone can benefit from when using biicode. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg of the things a C and C++ developer can do with biicode. Read more about our features <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/features/cpp/">here</a>.</p><h2>Proud to work with Elecnor Deimos</h2><p>As engineers we are not only proud to work with such talented teams in Elecnor Deimos but also, as a start-up we are extremely happy to see an experienced company like Elecnor Deimos put trust and start off new projects with young start-ups like us or our fellow comrades <b>CartoDB</b>. They, alongside Orange, have launched a thrilling project called <a
href="http://cartodb.com/marketplace/apps/telemaps/">Telemaps</a>, check it out!</p><p>In conclusion, we are terribly satisfied with this agreement and eager to provide a good support and service. Like the recently released premium accounts, any upcoming feature can be found in our <a

href="http://blog.biicode.com/tos-dont-like-well-others/">previous post</a> and we explained then why we hadn&#8217;t paid enough attention to them while the developing the tool. The latter has evolved and added such degrees of complexity that the legal support for the users and the company needed a rethink and a rephrasing to say the least. And that&#8217;s exactly what we did: after consulting with our legal counselors and talking to companies that provide similar services, we have revamped the ToS, check the new ones <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.</p><p><img
class=" wp-image-1597 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/terms-of-service.jpg" alt="biicode's new Terms of service" width="800" height="197" /></p><h2></h2><p><span
id="more-2191"></span></p><h2>A few things about the new Terms of Service</h2><p>The aforementioned degrees of complexity can be listed as follows:</p><ul><li>Going open source</li><li>User code licensing</li><li>Deletion of accounts</li><li>Free and Premium accounts</li></ul><h3>Open Source</h3><p>biicode just announced the release of its code (read more <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-client/">here</a>), thus the new ToS take this new reality into consideration. In fact, alongside the <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, <a
href="http://web.biicode.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and the licence under which the user&#8217;s code is, these ToS guide the usage of the tools. Therefor their importance is capital and, as you can see we do not modify them carelessly or unadvisedly; on the contrary we welcome your input and we try as much as possible to be developer friendly. We support as much as we can the C and C++ communities.</p><h3>Licence</h3><p>We have released both the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/client/blob/develop/LICENSE">client</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/biicode/common/blob/develop/LICENSE">common services</a> of biicode under <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT licence</a>. We believe this license gives free space for anyone to fork, modify, merge etc. biicode&#8217;s code and thus experiment or even create with it new products. Again, we&#8217;d love to see the C and C++ community blossom with tools that conform a modern programming environment.</p><p>Another aspect of the licensing of code affects the code supported (uploaded to) biicode&#8217;s cloud. We have also modified this application of the ToS in favour of easily licensing user. If no licence is indicated, full copyright protection is granted to the user that uploaded the code except for biicode&#8217;s Minimum Required Licence required to provide the services of access and query to other user&#8217;s of the code uploaded to free accounts, i.e. to show it in the our site.</p><p>All of biicode&#8217;s users will be informed of these changes in an email to come in the next few days.</p><p>Anyway, please take a look at the <a

To make one&#8217;s source code dependent on any of them, just use #includes. Today biicode is releasing the source code of the client and the common services as part of a programmatic, comprehensive, full-on open source roadmap.</p><p>One of the biggest aims of biicode&#8217;s founders was to provide a useful and modern tool for the C and C++ communities. Because some of us believe that, despite the wonderful adoption and usage numbers of both programming languages, the current programming environment is not the best to address the challenges the software industry needs. We are trying to improve this landscape by providing a multi-language, cross-platform dependency manager that incorporates CMake as build system. A transversal, multipurpose, open source tool.</p><p>Fortunately for us, there is a vast community of open source advocates amongst the C and C++ developers. Thus our step forward by welcoming the C and C++ communities to our development efforts. We have now on our side a whole army of developers and thus we feel stronger. <strong>Much stronger</strong>.<br

id="more-2177"></span></p><h2>The challenges ahead: biicode as an open source project</h2><p>Open sourcing software developed by a small start-up like us is not easy. Evidence says that, regardless of community adoption, it does not guarantee success at all. Just today, <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/the-real-reason-open-source-startups-fail/">TechCrunch raises awareness</a> on this regards. It is not only an important decision on which to reflect deeply but neither an easy path to tread on. For example, once the client is released we need to provide the appropriate structure for our community to collaborate and contribute conveniently; not an easy task for a small team overloaded with work.</p><p>We are however committed to do so. We said it in <a
href="https://opensource.com/business/15/1/biicode-open-source-dependency-manager">Opensource.com</a> and we say it here now again: <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">we will release progressively every part of biicode&#8217;s codebase</span>. Step by step, steadily and comprehensively. We know this bold move will provide us with a broader more supportive and collaborative community, an invaluable asset we can enrich with our know-how in dependency management, in software support and software consultancy.<br
/> We had already a steady user growth since mid 2014 but the announcement in Opensource.com boosted the pace as you can see below:</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2188 size-full" title="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/Usersgraph.png" alt="User base growth after Opensource.com announcement" width="694" height="497" /></p><p>However, not only our user base has grown, in fact the use of the tool has raised considerably. People are experimenting with the workflows and are eventually finding biicode useful to manage their dependencies.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2189 size-full" title="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/APIgraph.png" alt="API use graph after Opensource.com announcement" width="655" height="471" /></p><p>This is just part of a larger open source strategy that will include every part of biicode&#8217;s code base and in a broader, more horizontal level we would like to follow <a
href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer</a>&#8216;s path and be completely transparent.<br
/> Because from now on and even before releasing the code, biicode belongs to its users. They have developed projects of many different kinds, providing such a quality feedback we cannot be grateful enough. There are game developers coding <a
href="http://small3d.org/biicodegame/">3D engines</a>, C++ devs trying <a
href="http://yacoder.net/blog/2015/04/05/boost-spirit-flatbuffers-catch-biicode-clion-github/">new technologies</a>, coders interested in <a
href="http://carlosvin.github.io/en/posts/first-biicode-poco.html">deps and package management</a>, keeping <a
href="http://zverovich.net/2014/12/30/using-cppformat-with-biicode.html">libs up-to-date</a> etc.</p><h2>Open source client and common services</h2><p><img

/> Everything you need to know about biicode&#8217;s client release is in the <a
href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode">GitHub page</a> we have built to host all of our open source project. We welcome you on board and hope to see every single bug captured and fixed, any possible security issue reported and solved and great features and improvements being PR&#8217;ed!</p><p><a

We seek not only collaboration but also guidance. Please let us know where you want the tool to aim. Tell us about your issues when coding and how biicode could come in handy. Join us to provide C and C++ with a better programming environment.</p><h3><strong>The future is yours</strong></h3><p>These are just some of the things we believe a better C and C++ dependency manager should have and that we are already working on (check our <a

id="more-1868"></span></p><h2>Why sponsor Meeting C++?</h2><p>We are a C and C++ dependency manager. We are devoted to both communities. We want to stay updated and there is no better place for that to happen than in Meeting C++. We love C and C++. Our founders are university professors that have <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/category/our-story/">teached and developed in both languages for many years</a>. Hence they experimented the pain of not having a proper dependency management in any of them.</p><p>From that pain biicode was born. We have been two years developing it and it now starts to look pretty neat. Nevertheless the tool keeps evolving, improving and <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/biicode/release_notes.html">releases are pushed every two weeks</a>.</p><h2>C++ community</h2><p>Our community is growing too and that is why we want to spread the word more and more. Meeting C++ is the place to do so. <a
href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</a>, <a
href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/edouardalligand">Edouard Alligand</a>, <a
href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~hkaiser/">Hartmut Kaiser</a> and many more will be there. If some of the pro developers attending the conference know about biicode, use it just once and give feedback, the trip will be worth it. We are <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">open sourcing</a> it too precisely because of this: to get the support of the community, and build together a great deps manager for C++.</p><p>In conclusion, we are sponsoring the event to get our tool known and receive feedback to keep improving from the best C++ devs in the world. Their feedback will make it better and our community will not only be broader but way much better.</p><p>Thank you all and we hope to see you in Berlin in a month.</p><p>The post <a

href="https://twitter.com/diegorlosada">Diego Rodríguez-Losada</a> any time during the biicode&#8217;s two-year existence.</p><p>Especially when your product tries to address a common problem to almost 4 million of C and C++ developers &#8211; probably the largest development community by language &#8211; that however lacks what in other languages is a basic and a widespread tool: <strong>a dependency manager</strong>. It is true that several initiatives exist, as <a
href="https://github.com/ryppl?page=1">RYPPL</a>, <a
href="https://jpakkane.github.io/meson/">Meson</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/chrisvana/repobuild">Repobuild</a>, <a
href="http://cpmcpp.org/">CPMCPP</a>, but unfortunately none of them seem to have a large adoption.</p><p>We are proud of where <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/our-story-i/">we came from</a> and confident of <a
href="http://blog.biicode.com/file-based-cpp-dependency-manager/">what we have achieved</a>. We have worked hard to build it, developing and iterating a lot: for example we changed our full codebase from java to python in the process, or rebuilt more than 50% of our codebase in 1,5 months to release v1.0. So we didn&#8217;t even consider about making biicode open source. Until today.</p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/10/reward-sticker.31db154b1.png" alt="biicode open source campaign sticker" width="225" height="223" /></p><p><span
id="more-1832"></span></p><h2>The perks of open source</h2><p>We strongly believe in open source. We use it every day as most of our loved dev tools are open source, and we have realized that we always wanted our tool to be open sourced. Moreover, most of the feedback we are getting from the C/C++ community is that biicode has to be open source.</p><p>The fear of being open source as a business risk, was at least in our investors&#8217; mind, then again, until today. We have told them that we were going open source. They agreed, but with a small request: we have to reach 10K users first. And we accepted, so here we go: join us our quest to become open source. Please join our forces in enough number to show our investors that opening the source code is the right thing to do.</p><p>There are many reasons to believe you&#8217;ll join our mission. First, you will now know what you are installing in your computer, without any lock-in to the company and the possibility to adapt it to your needs. Another reason is simply that you feel the pain, and you would like to have a deps manager for C/C++ you can be part of. And last reason but not least, is to win a Darth Vader++ t-shirt and finally mock your fellow devs that program in inferior (at least not in the dark side :D) languages.</p><p>Besides, as recent Nobel Prize winner <a
href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Tirole">Jean Tirole</a> concludes in his paper <a
href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w7600">The Simple Economics of Open Source</a>, contributors to open source projects do not guide themselves by meer economic value but rather by their own professional growth developing a great tool the community appreciates. It&#8217;s a matter of reputation and skills. It&#8217;s also a matter of relevant tools that provide comfort and save time to devs. Opening our source code will only push the community together, engage the C/C++ community in solving the pain that originated the development of a C/C++ dependency manager like biicode. Initially&#8230; because from now on we will walk this path side by side.</p><h2>The mechanics of the open source quest</h2><p>Our investors need to know the demand is as real as we have promised. We know you guys want biicode to be open source but we need you to take action now and join us in this mission. We need to reach 10.000 users and then we will start to open our source code. We will immediately release the client then, as soon as possible the servers (they are highly coupled to our backend, we need to clean a little bit things first) so in-house hosting is also possible.</p><p>There are three simple steps to become a Master of biicode, <a
href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">try them now</a>!</p><p>The first step, becoming an <strong>explorer</strong> is the way to endorse us going open source. It can be completed in a matter of a few minutes, and is as simple as running the <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/c++/gettingstarted.html">getting started guide</a>. Don’t forget to run first</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ bii user your_username</pre><p>this way biicode knows you’re the one winning the badge!</p><p>Then, if you want to become a <strong>contributor</strong> and get a free sticker, simply publish some code. It can be just any program (Need some inspiration? Just <a

href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/joseluisgomezblazquez">Jose Luis Gómez</a> both of Bullnet. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our friends and investors from the Fundación Entrecanales, especially without <a
href="http://es.linkedin.com/pub/lourdes-%C3%A1lvarez-de-toledo/61/184/516">Lourdes Álvarez de Toledo</a> who managed to introduce us to many other interesting contacts like <a
