Fortunately, as the title says, it is only the company what is in trouble, biicode as a product/technology is at the moment in good health and operating properly. However, in our commitment of transparency with our users and stakeholders in general, we think it is important to let you know.</p><p>Biicode is a great project, but it is also a startup, a business. That means that we hired people to develop the platform, and expected that at some point our revenue would be able to pay that people and also hopefully generate some profit. But it didn’t. We have been running on our investors money plus some public government loans for the last years, and we have been able to develop what we think is an amazing technology. We were running out of cash, so we started to work on a new funding round well in advance. But finally we were not able to close it, and now our expenses and burn rate are not sustainable anymore, so we must continue without employees and face a new stage that will most probably mean closing the company.</p><p>As a startup we have made many of the errors a startup typically makes. An important one was probably that our technology was a bit opinionated about software engineering processes, and we failed to adequately and timely listen (that means also filtering out lots of noise) to user feedback. Even if we realized it almost a year ago and started to make huge changes to the platform through our 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 releases, that was not enough.</p><p>We were able to gather lots of users love from the open source community, and blog posts talking nicely about us started to flourish since last November’14, so we were able to grow about 25% month over month in activity (measured in API-calls to our server, that means, people actually using the tools to code with them), for the last 6 months.</p><p>But still, our total number of registered users was not as large as expected (now reaching 4000), and the most important reason: we failed to upsell the service and get enough premium paying customers. Practically all of the above activity was from open source users. But production C/C++ development can be quite different from other technologies, projects are very large, and introducing biicode in those projects is quite a time investment, and timings for new projects and introducing new technologies can be large too. Too large for a startup, even this technology could be a great business for a bigger corporation with more time and resources. We understand this can be a major concern for prospective investors, so we certainly do not blame on the VC ecosystem (in this case the Spanish/EU one) neither have we thought that our luck would be different in the USA.</p><p>I will write soon more detailed posts about all the many lessons learned in this startup adventure, but a very important one I don’t want to skip here is to acknowledge and be grateful. First I want to thanks the biicode team (you can find most of them http://web.biicode.com/meet-the-team/), especially those that have been “bleeding” with me the last months: Luis (Laso), David, Fran, Maria, Jordi, Manu and Miguel. Thanks for your passion, support, friendship, and the indecent amount of extra work hours. You are the best team a tech startup can dream of.</p><p>Many thanks to our investors Big Sur Ventures &#8211; Necotium and Fundacion Jose Manuel Entrecanales, who believed in biicode and have supported us for so long. They have both been great investors, but I want to give very special thanks to Jose Miguel Herrero, our lead investor from Big Sur Ventures &#8211; Necotium, for his incredible support and commitment. KPIs, go to market, strategy, funding, hiring,…  Even these tough days, when you get to know the real values of the people around you, we have learned so much from him thanks to his continuous involvement and support. If you have a great project looking for funding here in Spain or even Europe and you are not pitching Jose Miguel you are definitely missing an incredible opportunity.</p><p>And finally, you, our users: I don’t have words to say thanks enough. You have supported us, invest your time to help us improve thanks to your feedback, comments and suggestions. You have used biicode for your libraries and your projects, making our dream of such a tool a reality. Many of you have even said that you love it.  We were C and C++ developers, and seeing other colleagues use biicode and loving it is the best reward we could have, and you gave it to us. I am very sorry we have not managed to fully guarantee its survival in its current form.</p><p>But we have not given up, fortunately, biicode as a project/technology is alive, and even if our resources are lower, there are still hundreds of active users enjoying it. We have released a full stack as open source (MIT license), including a server you can host on premises. It still lacks a web interface, but is fully operational and can be managed with little “devops”, and having an open-source web interface is a matter of time. The central biicode servers, site and web are fully operational, and they will be for at least 6 months more, probably 1 year if possible. We will personally continue to operate and support them (up to the legal limits). What the future will be, nobody knows. We believe that it is a good moment for the community to take over and start to see biicode as ours, a project of the C/C++ developer’s community, and hopefully together we will find the way for it.</p><p>So this is not a goodbye, just the beginning of a new stage for biicode. See you there and thanks again for everything.</p><p>Diego<br

href="http://eax.me/">this blog</a> [the author&#8217;s blog] had shown in the topic &#8220;should we let kittens play with new balls of wool?&#8221; So I felt like sharing a few more of my reflections on a related subject in regard to the C and C++ languages and the odds that Rust will kill them. No need to tell you that it will inevitably cause a big holy war, so before you proceed, think twice if you really want to go on reading this post and especially participate in a &#8220;constructive debate&#8221; via comments.</p><p><span
id="more-2248"></span></p><p>The original article can be found <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=733">here</a> (in Russian). It was translated and published in our blog by the author’s permission.</p><p><em>Note</em>: Further in this text, I am presuming that Rust is a conscious attempt to create a <em>fast </em>and safe language. After all, it was initially conceived by the guys from Mozilla as a tool to develop a <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1539">browser engine</a>. But if it proves to be yet another <em>just </em>safe language, then I just don’t get the whole thing. There is plenty of very different safe languages to choose from to any taste, and if Rust is not meant to replace C++, then (1) why does it need to include an unsafe subset?; and (2) why did the authors <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1540">throw away lightweight processes from Rust</a>? They are convenient, after all, aren’t they? In other words, if I’m wrong in my assumption, then the whole affair just doesn’t seem to make any sense at all.</p><p>If you happen to occasionally drop by the linux.org.ru forum, be warned that this post doesn’t have to do with the list of 10 purely technical reasons for not liking <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1541">Rust</a> that was <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1542">discussed in this thread</a>. A Skype conversation with <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1543">dear comrade @sum3rman</a> has revealed that there is more than one opinion on how much &#8220;technical&#8221; those reasons are. So I have to admit that the list I composed is a lousy one but I’m still taking a risk to cite some of the most interesting clauses from it here. Actually, the number of plain common sense reasons alone is big enough to not care about the technical ones.</p><p>It is crystal clear for every sane programmer that C/C++ is not going to die in the nearest future. No one is going to rewrite almost all of the existing desktop applications, operating system kernels, compilers, game and browser engines, virtual machines, databases, archivers, audio and video codecs, tons of other C-libraries, and so on and so forth, into other languages. This is a huge mass of fast, debugged, and time-proven code. Rewriting it is way, way too expensive, risky, and, honestly, doesn’t seem to make sense except in the heads of the most frantic Rust fans. The demand for C/C++ programmers has always been high and will remain so for a long time to come.</p><p>OK, what about using Rust to write new code then?</p><p>Well, as you probably remember, it is far not the first attempt to create a &#8220;better&#8221; C/C++. Take the D language, for instance. It was released in 2001 and is a good language indeed. But there are no vacancies, no decent development tools, no remarkable success stories associated with it. The <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1544">OpenMW</a> project was initially started in D but then the authors suddenly decided to <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1545">completely rewrite it into C++</a>. As they <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1546">confessed</a>, they’d been receiving piles of emails where people would say, &#8220;you are making a cool project and we’d like to contribute to it, but we don’t know and neither feel like studying this silly D&#8221;. Wikipedia tells us that there were a lot of other attempts besides D to kill C++ – for example <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1547">Vala</a>, Cyclone, Limbo, BitC. How many of you have even heard of these languages?</p><p>I think it’s high time we started learning lessons of history. No one sane will ever start using a new language in their projects until you show them a few cool development tools supporting it, tell them a couple of success stories, and show a dozen of programmers working with that language and living close by. As for programmers, they will never – except probably for the youngest ones – spend their time and health on learning another &#8220;very best&#8221; language until you show them a few cool development tools (not a frob like Racer) and a couple of <em>tens of thousands </em>of ready-made libraries (not &#8220;experimental&#8221; or &#8220;unstable&#8221; or stuff like that), tell them a couple of success stories, and show them a dozen of open vacancies in their city or town. You know, it’s like the &#8220;Chicken or the Egg&#8221; dilemma. On very rare occasions, this problem does get resolved (relatively representative examples are <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1548">Go</a> and <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1549">Scala</a>) – mostly thanks to investments of time and money from some large company (Google, Typesafe) who for some reason finds it worthy to popularize a new language.</p><p>As I already mentioned, there are too many <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1550">non-technical reasons</a> alone to feel skeptical about Rust. But let’s imagine for a moment they just do not exist. Then there would be no reasons to <em>not </em>write in Rust, right? Well, this too is very arguable, to say the least.</p><p>C/C++ is criticized for a variety of reasons. By the way, most of the critics have never seen C++ code in production. To put it brief and clear, the issue with C++ is that it is very fast (and also demanding little memory, battery charge, etc.) but not safe in the sense that it allows array overruns, addressing freed memory, and so on. Back in the past, this problem urged programmers to develop a variety of safe languages such as Java, C#, Python, and others. But they have proved to be too resource-demanding compared to C++ and have some other drawbacks as well – take, for instance, the inevitable &#8220;stop the world&#8221; issue during garbage collection. That’s why programmers are struggling to create a language as fast as C++ but also safe. Rust is one of the candidates.</p><p>Rust is safe indeed but, unfortunately, far from fast. By the moment of writing this article, it is <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1551">comparable</a> to Java, Go, and Haskell regarding performance:</p><p><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-2249 size-full" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/Ten-tiny-exmaples.png" alt="C++ will never die" width="516" height="324" /></p><p>I sincerely hope that programmers will find a way to speed it up in time, but until then, it’s going to be of hardly more interest than Scala or Go from the viewpoint of the safety/speed compromise. The question is still open if it is possible at all to make a language both fast and safe or if it is automatically doomed to be twice slower than C/C++ because of the constant checks for array overruns, safe wraps of bindings to C-libraries, and other stuff like that.</p><p>And what actually makes Rust safe, by the way? To put it simple, this is a language with a built-in code analyzer and it’s a pretty tough one: it can catch all the bugs typical of C++ and <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1552">dealing not only with memory management, but multithreading as well</a>. Pass a reference to an assignable object through a pipe to another thread and then try to use this reference yourself – the program just will refuse to compile. And that’s really cool.</p><p>But C++ too hasn’t stood still during the last 30 years, and plenty of both <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/ru/pvs-studio/">static</a> and dynamic analyzers supporting it have been released during this time. Just as one example, watch a short video about <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1554">Google sanitizers</a> – they are really <em>very</em> tough. Anyway, in any serious project, you use a <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1555">continuous integration system</a> and run tons of tests when compiling builds. If you don’t, then your troubles are much worse than the language’s lack of safety because static typing doesn’t guarantee correct execution logic! So, since you run tests anyway, why not use sanitizers as well? True, they don’t find all the bugs. On the other hand, if you don’t have a check for an array overrun somewhere at the deeper levels of your code and a sanitizer doesn’t report the bug, maybe it’s just because all the necessary checks are already provided one level higher and another one would only slow down the program? Even without sanitizers, you’ll find lots of stuff just building the project with various compilers on different platforms with assert’s checking your code’s invariants in the &#8220;assert(obj-&gt;isValid)&#8221; fashion and with proper fuzzing. Put rough, the question actually comes down to the good old holy war about the <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1556">(t)he(o)retic and kolkhoz approaches</a> to software development (<em>that is, an innovative yet too idealistic approach and a traditional empirical approach thought to be careless and simplistic by the supporters of the former – note by translator</em>).</p><p>You can often hear an argument that <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1557">90% of the execution time is spent executing only 10% of the code</a> (which is, as far as I get, just an empirical law – a quick scan through the Web has failed to reveal any strict scientific researches on this subject). Therefore, you can write most of your code in safe Rust and the rest 10% (the &#8220;hot&#8221; code) in its unsafe subset, so the bad performance of the current Rust implementation is actually not a problem. OK, but doesn’t it imply that I do not need Rust at all because I could write 90% of my code in Go and the rest 10% in C? Only silver bullet seekers and airy-fairy (t)he(o)retics will use Rust just for the sake of feeling contented about having 100% of a program written in seemingly one language. But these are actually two dialects of one language, which doesn’t look much different from the &#8220;Java + C&#8221; or &#8220;Go + C&#8221; combos.</p><p>But the 90/10 law is rubbish anyway. Following its logic, we could rewrite 90% of WebKit or VirtualBox or GCC into Java and get the same result. But it is obviously wrong. Even if it’s not because the ratio is very much different in some programs, let’s do some calculations and see. Suppose an entire program is written in unsafe C/C++ and its execution time is, say, 0.9*1 (a small portion of hot code) + 0.1*1 (a bulk of cold code) = 1. Now compare it to a program written in a safe language with C inserts: 0.9*1 + 0.1*2 = 1.1, which, theoretically speaking, makes the difference of 10%. Is it much or little? Well, it depends on the project scale. For Google, even a few percent may <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1558">help save millions of dollars</a> (see Section 5, &#8220;Utilization&#8221;, in the paper). Or imagine that with a next update, JVM will suddenly start requiring 10% more resources! I’m scared to even make any guesses about how many zeroes they’ll get in the figure after converting those percent into dollars! 10% is a whole lot for tasks where C and C++ are used.</p><p>We keep chanting the phrase &#8220;premature optimization is the root of all evil&#8221; like a mantra. But if we want to follow it word for word, why not use bubble sort instead of quicksort in all of the code? After all, we can’t know for sure where we’ll get a bottleneck, can we? Why wrap regular action counters into actors or transactional memory when we can use more efficient atomics right away? And, generally speaking, in <em>trivial cases</em>, it doesn’t make sense at all to forcedly initialize each and every single variable, implement a pile of auxiliary checks, and so on. Let there even be a 2-5% performance boost instead of 10%, but it’s not that bad if it took you just an extra couple of minutes to think over. Besides, as we have already figured out, it can make a huge difference in C/C++ programs! After all, who will dare to argue that finding a hot spot, rewriting the code (perhaps tons of it) and proving it has become really faster is an easier job than think about performance in advance?</p><p>Even apart from that speed/safety compromise issue, I’m also skeptical about the language’s design as such. In particular as regards to the five types of pointers used in it. On the one hand, it’s not bad to make programmers ponder if their variables are stored in the stack or heap and if they can or cannot be handled by several threads at a time. But on the other hand, imagine you are writing a program and discover at one moment that some variable should be stored in the heap instead of the stack. So you rewrite the code to use Box. Then you figure out that you actually need Rc or Arc. Again, you rewrite all that code. And then, once again, you rewrite it all to have an ordinary variable in the stack. All of that you have to do without a decent IDE at hand. Regular expressions won’t help. Or you might just <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1559">end up with a nightmare</a> like &#8220;Vec&lt;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Box&lt;Trait&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&#8221; – say hello to Java! But the saddest thing about it is that the compiler already knows everything about the lifetime of every variable and could automatically insert all those Box’s, Arc’s, etc. But for some reason, this duty was shifted on to the programmer. It would be much more convenient to let the programmer simply write val (we are living in the third millennium, after all!) and explicitly specify Box or Rc where necessary. From this viewpoint, Rust’s developers have screwed up the whole thing.</p><p>This, in particular, makes Rust’s scope much narrower. No one sane will write web and server-side software in a language like<em> that </em>– especially considering that it doesn’t offer any significant advantages over those languages for JVM. Even Go – with <em>normal </em>lightweight processes (not <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1560">futures</a>) – seems a way better choice for solving these tasks. As for futures, you have to learn how to handle them right not to shoot yourself in the foot – and you are talking of &#8220;safe languages&#8221;, huh? Sure, all these languages have their own peculiarities – take that very &#8220;stop the world&#8221;, for example. But this problem can be solved both by splitting the code into <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1561">micro services</a> and through <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1562">other techniques</a>. And yes, no one will be willing to translate Rust into JavaScript, use it to write scripts for AWS or as a query language for MongoDB. For Android, it’s also hardly probable, but for a different reason: there is way more than one architecture there, so JVM will do much better. So if you happen to think that Rust is &#8220;good for any task&#8221;, I have to disappoint you.</p><p>And here’s a few more reasons to finish it off:</p><ul><li>Macros used as a crutch to make up for the excessive verbosity caused by the absence of normal exceptions. I already wrote about the <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1563">metaprogramming issues</a> – it is because of them, in particular, that we are hardly ever to get a decent IDE for Rust. Also, though I’m not sure, it seems that macros in Rust don’t even have namespaces.</li><li>People are idiots and cargo actively encourages downloading packages directly from git repositories, bypassing Crates.io. As a result, we risk ending up with a huge mess with packages like in the Erlang world with its Rabar. By the way, I suspect the Go world has a similar trouble.</li><li>Like many of new languages, Rust is walking the path of simplification. I can generally understand why it doesn’t have a decent inheritance and exceptions, but the fact itself that someone is making decisions for me regarding things like that makes me feel somewhat displeased. C++ doesn’t restrict programmers regarding what they can or cannot use.</li><li>Now, since we have taken the path of simplification, why not throw away all those language extensions? The current state of things resembles the Haskell world where every programmer is coding in their own dialect.</li><li>Smart pointers, for you to know, are far not free of charge and <em>do not ensure </em>a fixed time of garbage collection. What if some thread gets honor to free a very deep data structure? While it is wandering a labyrinth of dead references, all the other threads depending on it are patiently waiting dumb. Erlang with its small pieces has a similar trouble – I’ve faced it myself many times. Smart pointers also have problems of their own – for example memory fragmentation and leaks. Just leave a weak pointer in a loop structure – the whole thing is screwed up. And all that in a language pretending to be safe&#8230; If you want a fixed GC time, study your program’s behavior under load and take precautions (for example, provide for object pools) if you are not satisfied with the figures, or manage memory manually.</li><li>Has anyone seen a <em>strict </em>description of Rust’s semantics? Does it have a memory model at least? And you call it a &#8220;safe&#8221; language &#8220;ensuring correctness&#8221; of programs, especially considering that it can interpret the source code in ten different ways?</li><li>I can’t but remind you for one more time that <strong>the source of troubles is usually in humans, not technology</strong>. If your C++ code is not good enough or Java code is painfully slow, it’s not because the technology is bad – it’s because you haven’t learned how to use it right. That way, you won’t be satisfied with Rust either, but just for some other reasons. Isn’t it easier to learn how to use more popular tools and start liking them?</li></ul><p>So, to sum it up, personally I will be investing my time into studying C/C++ rather than Rust in the next 5 or so years. C++ is an <em>industrial standard.</em> Programmers have been using it to solve a huge variety of tasks for over 30 years now. As for Rust and stuff like that – they are just odd toys with vague future. People have been predicting C++’s soon death since the 2000-s, but C/C++ hasn’t become less used and demanded for since then. Quite on the contrary, in fact. It is evolving (C ++11, C++14), new tools are released (take <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1564">CLion</a> and Clang, for example), and the number of vacancies is just huge.</p><p>A C++ programmer will hardly ever have any difficulties finding a job with a <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1565">more than worthy salary</a> and, if necessary, can quickly <a
href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php?url=1566">learn</a> Rust. But the opposite scenario is very, very unlikely. By the way, the language choice is far not the only and most important factor when picking a new job. Besides, a skilled C/C++ programmer can easily find their way in PostgreSQL’s or Linux kernel’s source code, has access to modern powerful development tools, and has a pile of books and articles at hand (for example on OpenGL).</p><p>So, take care of your health and don’t waste your time – you have less of those than you think!</p><p>The post <a

Our tool already includes its core dependency management features alongside CMake build system. With biicode you can also publish your code to our cloud and keep it private. But a complete environment requires more tools like IDEs, compilers etc. Since software is present everywhere and the state of technology requires it to be up-to-date constantly, developers work hard to push their code&#8217;s latest version as soon as they know it works better than the previous one.<br

But software evolves constantly and it does so in versions. When handling dependencies one of the aspects a developer has to take into account is the version of the software linked. VersionEye will monitor versions and licenses from any open source project for free. For example, you can now monitor biicode itself since we recently went <a
href="http://biicode.github.io/biicode/">open source</a>. They offer other services for minimum prices too, go check them <a
href="https://www.versioneye.com/pricing">here</a>.</p><h3>How does VersionEye work</h3><p>VersionEye is a unique channel to keep you posted on the versions of the open source software you use. And admit it, <strong>you use a heck of a lot of OSS</strong>. VersionEye is simple: just upload your biicode.conf file to let VersionEye know your project dependencies. Once parsed, it will list them and you&#8217;ll be able to follow them and update them at the spot! This process will be done automatically by VersionEye so you have to worry about nothing. If you require more detail about how VersionEye works, find an in-depth explanation in their <a

Over three decades, many interesting tools have appeared in the field: debuggers, compilers, memory analyzers and code analyzers for these languages are evolving swiftly. But how about a dependency manager? Can C/C++ developers save their time by configuring and installing various libraries used in their projects?</p><p>Luckily there is a very interesting cross-platform tool called <a
href="http://www.biicode.com">biicode</a>. With biicode, you can reuse any single source file from any given project in any other project you are developing. It tracks and manages versions of published code and retrieves the missing files from the repository (GitHub and Bitbucket are supported for now). In its latest versions, it supports boost libraries, Eigen and many others, and can even work with <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/arduino.html">Arduino boards</a>. The original content is <a

id="more-2144"></span></p><p>Interestingly, biicode uses <b>CMake</b> to configure and build projects. Having that in common, we knew CLion and biicode had to start a relationship.</p><p><a
href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> is a cross-platform C/C++ IDE, which uses CMake build system as the project model. Now, there’s one more benefit you can get from it: a very simple and straightforward way to use biicode features together with the IDE. (You’ll need biicode 2.4.1 or higher and the latest CLion EAP.)</p><p>CMake layout for the project is generated by biicode commands, after which you can open the project directly in CLion. You can resolve dependencies and install the missing libraries easily by using <i>bii</i> commands from the CLion built-in terminal (Alt+F12). Let’s take a short overview of the overall process and some available features.</p><p>Download the latest version of biicode from the <a
href="http://www.biicode.com/downloads">biicode website</a>. To create a new project, run the command <i>bii init -l clion &lt;prj_name&gt;</i>, which will generate the proper layout to be used in CLion:</p><p><img
class=" size-large wp-image-2147 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/bii_init-copy-1024x381.png" alt="Just bii init in CLion and move on" width="630" height="234" /></p><p>To configure your project, run <i>bii cpp:configure</i>:</p><p><img
class=" size-large wp-image-2148 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/bii_configure-copy-1024x458.png" alt="Set-up the bii configure" width="630" height="282" /></p><p>As you can see, these commands produced CMake-based output which can be simply opened in CLion via File | Open… Now you can use CLion for working on your project.</p><p>One extra benefit is that <i>bii</i> commands can be called directly from the IDE’s terminal (open it with Alt+F12).</p><p>Let’s talk about resolving dependencies in your projects. Assume you are going to use boost libraries, for example, in very simple and demo-like code below:</p><p><img
class=" size-full wp-image-2149 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/boost_red-copy.png" alt="Resolving Boost dependency with biicode and CLion" width="804" height="322" /></p><p>Because the project doesn’t have any boost dependency, CLion highlights boost-related code with red; no code completion or navigation features are available at this point. We’ll update the CMakeLists.txt file following instructions from the <a
href="http://docs.biicode.com/c++/examples/boost.html">biicode website</a> as follows:</p><p><img
class=" size-full wp-image-2150 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/bii_boost_cmake-copy.png" alt="Resolved deps update CMake in biicode and CLion" width="934" height="356" /></p><p>Then we run the commands <i>bii find</i> and <i>bii cpp:configure</i>. After biicode downloads and installs all the missing dependencies and the CMake project in CLion is reloaded, the code is highlighted with green. Smart actions now work fine, as does code completion:</p><p><img
class=" size-full wp-image-2151 aligncenter" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/boost_completion-copy.png" alt="Boost depencendy resolved with biicode and CLion" width="806" height="464" /></p><p>That’s it! Get <a
href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program">CLion EAP build</a> and install <a
href="http://www.biicode.com/downloads">biicode</a> to try them together now.</p><p>The post <a

Daniel García</a> &#8211; his slides though are only available in Spanish.</p><p>Unexpected as it was &#8211; because Codemotion Marid 2014 focus&#8217; wasn&#8217;t C ++, surprise! &#8211; <em>Concurrency in Modern C++</em> was packed. It was a 45-minute introduction to the new language mechanisms for portable concurrency in C++ 11/14. A success.</p><p>A brief summary:</p><ul><li>Seems free lunch is over</li><li>C++ offers a portable mechanism for concurrency</li><li>Minimal concurrency through asynchronous tasks</li><li>Use threads to more detailed concurrency control</li><li>mutex as a basic concurrency mechanism</li><li>There&#8217;s a lot more &#8211; using a graphics card without OpenGL or CUDA?</li></ul><h3>J. Daniel Garcia:  &#8220;Simplifying  Dynamic Memory&#8221;</h3><p>J. Daniel explained with grace the difference between moving and copying:</p><ul><li>Everything that is born, dies.</li><li>Copying is expensive, moving is cheap &#8211; My daughter would rather move her homework from the living room to her room than making homework again to locate a copy on each place.</li><li>Use smart pointers &#8211; be mindful when using explicit new/delete + no need for a <a

A great diversity of technologies, languages, companies and areas of software development met at Codemotion Madrid 2014.</p><p>As usual in this conferences, this diversity wasn’t evenly distributed, more than fifty percent of the conferences were about web. Altough technologies as C++ have also found its way into CodeMotion Madrid 2014 this year, we would like that in future editions other topics could also get more coverage: C/C++, embedded systems, IoT, HPC, industrial software and design, etc.</p><p>About the organization, we think it could be improved, there were talks in which there were no volunteers attending and the speakers had to ask for help to the attendees. Also, the number of attendants exceeded most of the halls&#8217; capacities too many times. Capacity was so low that lots of people weren’t able to attend talks and needed to find a room with an available seat even though they weren’t interested in that talk, just because all the rooms were full.</p><p>If this type of conference wants to increase in popularity and prestige, these are some issues that should be adressed.</p><h4>Codemotion Madrid 2014 Agenda</h4><p>Keep an eye on <a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1848" src="http://blog.biicode.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/10/cmakebanner1.jpg" alt="Custom CMake toolchain is now a feature in biicode" width="280" height="77" /></p><p><span
id="more-1929"></span></p><h2>Develop as usual</h2><p>To start, let’s configure a biicode project to work with your usual editor, compiler and IDE.<br
/> Execute:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ cmake --help</pre><p>to show a list of CMake generators available in your system, these might be “<code>Eclipse CDT4 - Ninja</code>”, “<code>Unix Makefiles</code>”, “<code>Visual Studio 10</code>”, “<code>Sublime Text 2</code>” or others. Choose yours and tell bii to configure:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ bii cpp:configure -G “Visual Studio 10”</pre><p>Is it an arduino project? Write <code>bii arduino:configure -G “Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles”</code></p><p>Want to debug? <code>$ bii cpp:configure -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG</code></p><p>Use them all together:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ bii cpp:configure -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG”</pre><p>Note that <code>bii cpp:configure </code>admits any CMake directives</p><p><code>bii clean</code> to restore default project settings, those are MinGW Makefiles (Windows) or UNIX Makefiles (MacOS and Linux) and no IDE.</p><h2>Advanced CMake configuration through CMakeLists.txt</h2><p>It’s usual to have a previous build config in which some parts are shared with biicode and others are specific for the old way out of dependency hell. We’ve developed a way to maintain both ways on your CMakeLists.txt:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#shared configuration here
IF(BIICODE)
   include(${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/biicode.cmake)
   INIT_BIICODE_BLOCK()
   ADD_BIICODE_TARGETS()
ELSE()
      # Your old project configuration here
ENDIF()</pre><p>And that’s it, as you can see in previous posts , this process is more or less straight forward depending on the library’s complexity: Json11 by Dropbox, Box2D by Erin Catto, Little CMS by Marti Maria or Oscpack by Ross Bencina.</p><h4>INIT_BIICODE_BLOCK()</h4><p>This function defines these variables:</p><ul><li><code>${BII_BLOCK_NAME} </code>The name of the current block (e.g. &#8220;box2d&#8221;)</li><li><code>${BII_BLOCK_USER} </code>The user&#8217;s name (e.g. &#8220;phil&#8221;)</li><li><code>${BII_BLOCK_PREFIX} </code>The directory where the block is located (&#8220;blocks&#8221; or &#8220;deps&#8221;)</li></ul><p>It also loads variables and  you can use or modify them. Check the default CMakeLists.txt comments to learn more.</p><h4>ADD_BIICODE_TARGETS()</h4><p>A CMake <code>TARGET</code> represents each one of the executables or libraries CMake compiles. This function defines these variables:</p><ul><li><code>${BII_BLOCK_TARGETS} </code>List of targets defined in this block</li><li><code>${BII_LIB_TARGET} </code> This is the library biicode builds for each one of the blocks within your project. Just the target library name, usually in the form &#8220;user_block&#8221;</li><li> You can also use directly the name of the executable target (e.g. user_block_main)</li></ul><h2>10 CMake Tips</h2><h3>#1 Variable declaration</h3><p>STRING is a basic CMake variable. It can be used as part of any other identificator.<br
/> Like the preprocessor, if the var name is enclosed between {} and preceded by $, that expression is equal to the contents of the variable:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">set(MYVAR /var/run/bootstamp)
# is equivalent to:
set(MYVAR “/var/run/bootstamp”)
# list and text substitution examples:
set(MYVAR “element1” )
set(${MYVAR}_name “hello”)
set(MYVAR2 element1 “${MYVAR}_name” element3 ${${MY_VAR}_name}})</pre><p>As CMake stores the sets as a string where elements are separated by &#8220;;&#8221;-&gt; MYVAR2 contains the string <code>“element1;element1_name;element3;hello”</code></p><h3>#2 Logging to Screen</h3><p>Fatal error messages interrupt the CMake execution:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">message("hello world MYVAR=${MYVAR}")
message(SEND_ERROR "Should not have got here")
message(FATAL_ERROR "Something bad happened")</pre><p></p><h3>#3 Relevant CMake vars</h3><h4>DIRECTORIES</h4><ul><li><b><code>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</code></b>: source directory currently being processed</li><li><b><code>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</code></b>: binary directory currently being processed</li><li><b><code>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code></b>: directory being used as IDE run</li></ul><h4>SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</h4><ul><li><b><code>APPLE</code></b>: True if running on Mac OS X</li><li><b><code>UNIX</code></b>: True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems (i.e.: APPLE and CYGWIN)</li><li><b><code>MSVC:</code></b> True when using Microsoft Visual C</li><li><b><code>WIN32</code></b>: True on windows systems, including win64</li><li><b><code>MINGW</code></b>: True when generating MinGW Makefiles</li><li><b><code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code></b>: Name of system cmake is being run on</li></ul><p><a
title="SDL CMakeLists.txt" href="http://www.biicode.com/miguel/miguel/sdl2/master/1/CMakeLists.txt" target="_blank">SDL CMakeLists.txt </a> is a clarifying example of use, take a look at from line 193 and on to see CMake vars in use.</p><h3>#4 Conditionals</h3><p>CMake Control Statements have an opening and a closing keyword that must be placed in exclusive lines. Also, CMake commands always have to include “()”</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">if(expression)
  	...
elseif(expression)
  	...
else()
  	...
endif()</pre><p></p><h4>Here&#8217;s some common if expressions:</h4><ul><li><b><code>if(MSVC)</code></b><b>  </b>True if the compiler is visual studio</li><li><b><code>if(NOT APPLE)</code></b> True if Linux, Windows, &#8230;</li><li><b><code>if(WIN32 AND NOT MSVC)</code></b> True  on MinGW compiler env</li><li><b><code>if(TARGET target-name) </code></b> True if the given name is an existing target.</li><li><b><code>if(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME MATCHES “.*Linux”)</code></b> true for linux systems</li><li><b><code>if(MINGW</code>)</b> useful for MinGW detection</li><li><b><code>if(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)</code></b><br
/> <b>   <code>set(UNIX_SYS ON)</code></b><br
/> <b><code>else()</code></b><br
/> <b>   <code>set(UNIX_SYS OFF)</code></b><br
/> <b><code>endif() </code>  </b>Simple way to differentiate between Apple and UNIX</li><li><code><b>if(MSVC_VERSION GREATER 1600)</b> </code>True for MSVC 12 and more recent versions</li></ul><h3>#5 Operations with lists</h3><h4>Removing elements from a &#8220;;&#8221; list:</h4><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">SET(MYLIST "elem1;elem2;elem3;elem4")
list(REMOVE_ITEM MYLIST elem1 elem3)</pre><p>Or (removing elements from a list)</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">SET(MYLIST  elem1 elem2 elem3 elem4)
list(REMOVE_ITEM MYLIST elem1 elem3)</pre><p></p><h4>Remove “UDPwin32.cpp” source file on compilation time:</h4><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">list(REMOVE_ITEM BII_LIB_SRC “src/nat/UDPwin32.cpp”)</pre><p>This one is pretty useful when you don&#8217;t want to consider or not a file depending on the OS compiling.</p><h4>Adding elements to a list</h4><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">list(APPEND MYLIST elem5 elem6)</pre><p></p><h4>Check if a list contains a value</h4><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">list(FIND MYLIST_VAR "src/google.cpp" HasGoogleFile)
IF(HasGoogleFile EQUAL -1)
	message(FATAL_ERROR "I could not find google.cpp")
ENDIF()</pre><p></p><h3>#6 Setting the directories used by the compiler</h3><h4>Adding an include path to the compiler for the current project.</h4><p>This syntax is better for directories needed only in compilation phase, not to be reused.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(/some/directory)

Biicode makes things so much easier that developing the simplest games is at almost anyone’s reach. To become an excellent programer like Nacho though a lot of hard work and practice is required. And that’s precisely what our interns David Virseda and Santiago Hurtado did. Based on the Flappy Bird idea they developed using biicode the Flappy Bii game. Developing Flappy Bii is simple, you just have to follow these steps.</p><h2>Make your own Flappy Bii game using Box2D and GLUI libraries.</h2><p>Box2D is a library with biicode. Box2D is an open source C++ engine to simulate rigid bodies in 2D, it is also used in different video-games AngryBirds motor engine.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Credit: http://blog.blprnt.com/</p></div><p>GLUT (OpenGL UtilityToolkit) is an open source library that we use in our game to develop graphics, windows management and mouse control, and to draw all the graphic elements of the game. To use BOX2D and GLUT, you only have to include these in your code:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#include "glui/glutwrapper/glut.h"
#include "erincatto/box2d/box2d/box2d.h"</pre><p>Find your dependency to these libraries with ~$ bii find, and the files box2d.h and glui.h will be downloaded along with the dependencies needed into the deps folder at your project. Follow these steps to play Flappy Bii game: Create a new project:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~$ bii init flappy_bii</pre><p>Open the code block that contains the game functionality on Biicode:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~/$ cd flappy_bii
~/flappy_bii$ bii open xunty/flappy_bii</pre><p>Finally, compile and execute your program and you’re ready to play! Compile:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~/flappy_bii$ bii cpp:build</pre><p>Execute: For Windows, double click on the .exe created.</p><p>For Linux and MacOS:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">~/flappy_bii$ .bin/xunty_flappy_bii_main</pre><p>To play Flappy Bii game, all you have to do is clicking the right mouse button in the game’s window to make the bii fly and pass between the gaps of the columns.</p><div

href="https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/blocks/pablodev/bitscan/branches/master">our exclusive C++ library developed by Pablo San Segundo</a> for sets of bits greater than the CPU register word, has proven its efficiency!</p><p>In order to find out if BITSCAN  was fast enough to be a substantial improvement over other libraries that manage bit strings, it has been  compared with std::bitset and  boost::dynamic_bitset similar data structures.</p><h3>A comment on basic features</h3><p><a
title="stl: :bitset" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/bitset/" target="_blank">STL &#8216;s Bitset (stl∷bitset)</a> is NOT dynamic (i.e. the size of the bit string must be provided in compilation time by as a template parameter), so it does not actually provide the same functionality.</p><p><a
title="boost:dynamic_bitset" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.html" target="_blank">Boost´s Dynamic Bitset (boost:dynamic_bitset)</a> is similar in functionality  in fast forward bit scanning. However, Boost does NOT currently support reverse bit scanning which is important in many applications.</p><p><span
id="more-483"></span></p><h3>The test</h3><p>We have compared the following functions:</p><p>1-<strong>Bit access:</strong> The ability to test whether a given bit is present in a given position</p><p>2<strong>-Population count</strong>: The ability to count the number of bits to 1 in a bitstring</p><p>3-<strong>Forward bit scanning (also known as LSB scanning)</strong> over the whole range of the bit string: Extracts the position of the 1-bits in sequential order starting from the least significant.</p><p>4-<strong>Reverse bit scanning (also known as MSB scanning)</strong> over the full range of the bit string: Same as (3) but in reverse order (and typically slower). As mentioned earlier neither Boost  (nor STL) currently support this functionality in their bit data structures. Actually the boost::dynamic_bitset interface  has only find_first(…) and find_next(…) functions and it would be really nice if in the next version find.last(…)  and find_previous(..) were available, since there are many applications where this is very useful indeed.</p><p>In the cases of bit scanning (3, 4) we have considered two variants which are related to the typical use in concrete applications: A) Destructive and B) Non destructive.</p><ul><li>In (A) or destructive case, once the position of the bit is read it is removed from the bitstring. This somehow easies the task of bit scanning because the main loop only has to look for the least  (most) significant bit at each step. The bad part is that the information is lost.</li><li>In the non-destructive case (B), the bit string is left intact at the end of the process. This requires additional operations w.r.t. (A) to filter out those 1-bits already picked at each 64-bit block.</li></ul><p>The code used to run these tests is located here: <a
style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/blocks/pablodev/bitscan_tests/branches/master" target="_blank">https://www.biicode.com/pablodev/blocks/pablodev/bitscan_tests/branches/master</a>.</p><p>BOOST should be installed in your local machine if you want to execute it.</p><h3>Test configuration</h3><p>Tests have been carried out on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 920 @ 3.67GHz, 6GB RAM with a  Windows 7, 64bit O.S.</p><p>We considered bit strings with different populations (<em>n</em> ranging from 500 up to 20.000) and distributions (uniform densities <em>d,</em> range from 0.25 up to 0.9) to test the ability of the data structures to reason from one bit-block to another. In all cases results are averaged over 100.000 repetitions.</p><p><em>Figure 1</em> shows performance results. From now on we will refer to the different bit string implementations by the source  (i.e. BOOST, STL and BITSCAN) for simplicity.  The concrete tests are:</p><ol><li>Population count (Figure 1, A) : Counting of 1 bits has been tested on the three implementations.</li><li>Destructive scans (Figure 1, E and F) : Scans which involve bit deletion after reading have been tested on BITSCAN and BOOST. STL has been left out because it is not dynamic.</li><li>Non destructive scans (Figure 1, C and D) : Scans which do not involve bit deletion after reading have been tested on BITSCAN and BOOST. STL has been left out similar to (2).</li><li>Reverse bit scan (Figure 1, B): It  has been compared against forward bit scanning only in BITSCAN since the other implementations do not offer a specific function for this task.</li><li>Access to bit positions: We have also tested concrete bit access in the 3 implementations. Reported results are not included because performance has been very similar in all cases.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td

colspan="2" width="581"><em>Figure 1. Performance tests for BITSCAN, BOOST and STL bitstring implementations</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Evaluation</h3><p>Population count is between 3x to 5x faster in BITSCAN than BOOST  and  STL, probably because the machine used for the tests exploited Intel´s intrinsic function library to the limit.  Although the result is possibly machine dependent, the order of magnitude of the improvement is indicative.</p><p>In destructive scans, BITSCAN is around 2x compared to BOOST. Noteworthy is that BITSCAN&#8217;s performance does not change much in very dense bit strings (i.e. &gt;0.75) , whereas BOOST shows certain degradation.</p><p>In the &#8220;regular&#8221; non destructive scan, BITSCAN is even slightly better (2.20x approx.) than in the previous case possibly because it caches better critical information related to the last bit read.</p><p>As to reverse (backwards) scanning, it performs comparably to forward scanning in BITSCAN and may be used without penalty.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>This report shows that <a
title="bitscan code" href="http://www.biicode.com/pablodev/bitscan" target="_blank">BITSCAN </a>is a leading state of the art alternative for programmers which look for efficiency in their implementations. Cutting edge research is showing that many combinatorial problems encoded with bit strings may be solved many times faster. Biicode sincerely hopes BITSCAN helps C, C++ developers throughout the world to make their code faster. It has already been employed successfully in a number of difficult and well known problems from the graph domain and many research papers describe how it can be done [<a
