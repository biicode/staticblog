The debate here could be which is the best &quot;fallback&quot; license, that will be implicitely used if no other license is explicitely added. You say that it could be a CreativeCommons one. Why not something equivalent to a more permissive one as MIT? I think it could be the best for the community.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I think all SW open-source licences allow copying and distribution, so I see no problem at all with biicode making a copy of the code, of course, keeping the original licence.

As you pointed out it is the same for github forks. One option to easily address this is to allow to upload code only under specific licenses.
