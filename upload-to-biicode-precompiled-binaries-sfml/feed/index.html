You probably didn&#039;t know, but I&#039;m a member of the SFML Team and having to deal with people not being able to build and link libraries correctly, makes you wonder if there are alternatives/easier ways. As such biicode is certainly something, I&#039;ll keep my eyes on. ;)]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hehe, I first need to try biicode.

We are planning to release a SFML block which builds from sources. Maybe you can try to build your own SFML from sources block? I challenge you :P Good luck!]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your comment. Is just a proof of concept to see if we can deploy binaries.

This works, but dependencies.bii is not aware of your compilation settings nor your system/architecture, so its hard to configure the setup to download the required binaries only (Windows x64 release, for example). Note how my example downloads all the binaries and then decides to what library it has to link to.
We are working in a hook system to configure all those things in a simple way, I hope we will be able to upload big precompiled libraries to biicode in the near future.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My approach is based on the dependencies.bii file as a bridge between the headers and the libraries to link with.
